Dependencies
============

Depends on a few standard libraries: python_ (the core language), numpy_ (for
numerical computation), scipy_ (for more specific mathematical operations),
cython_ (for extra speed), nibabel_ (for file formats; we require version 2.1
or higher) and h5py_ (for handling large datasets). Optionally, it can use
python-vtk_ (for visualisation), matplotlib_ (for scientific plotting), and
ipython_ (for interaction with the code and its results). cvxpy_ is required for
some modules.
