                   (DT-MRI) is noise sensitive, and the noise can induce
                   numerous systematic errors in subsequent parameter
                   calculations. This paper proposes a sparse
                   representation-based method for denoising cardiac
                   DT-MRI images. The method first generates a dictionary
                   of multiple bases according to the features of the
                   observed image. A segmentation algorithm based on
                   nonstationary degree detector is then introduced to
                   make the selection of atoms in the dictionary adapted
                   to the image's features. The denoising is achieved by
                   gradually approximating the underlying image using the
                   atoms selected from the generated dictionary. The
                   results on both simulated image and real cardiac DT-MRI
                   images from ex vivo human hearts show that the proposed
                   denoising method performs better than conventional
                   denoising techniques by preserving image contrast and
                   fine structures.},

                   regions of the human cerebral cortex are interconnected
                   by a dense network of cortico-cortical axonal pathways.
                   By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively
                   mapped these pathways within and across cortical
                   hemispheres in individual human participants. An
                   analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain
                   networks reveals a structural core within posterior
                   medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several
                   distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions
                   within the structural core share high degree, strength,
                   and betweenness centrality, and they constitute
                   connector hubs that link all major structural modules.
                   The structural core contains brain regions that form
                   the posterior components of the human default network.
                   Looking both within and outside of core regions, we

                   structural connectivity and resting-state functional
                   connectivity measured in the same participants. The
                   spatial and topological centrality of the core within

                   functional organization of the brain is a basic
                   challenge in neuroscience. However, direct evidence for
                   anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain
                   remains scarce. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor
                   imaging deterministic tractography to construct a
                   macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying
                   common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in
                   a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and
                   further quantitatively analyzed its topological
                   properties with graph theoretical approaches. The
                   cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions,
                   each representing a network node, and 2 cortical
                   regions were considered connected if the probability of
                   fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The
                   topological parameters of the established cortical
                   network (binarized) resemble that of a "small-world"
                   architecture characterized by an exponentially
                   truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics
                   imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore,
                   this cortical network was characterized by major hub
                   regions in association cortices that were connected by
                   bridge connections following long-range white matter
                   pathways. Our results are compatible with previous
                   structural and functional brain networks studies and
                   provide insight into the organizational principles of
                   human brain anatomical networks that underlie

                   three-dimensional model to explain this angular
                   dependence by decomposing the average propagator, which
                   describes the net displacement of water molecules, into
                   components parallel and perpendicular to the tube wall,
                   in which axial diffusion is free and radial diffusion
                   is restricted. The model faithfully predicts the
                   experimental data, not only the observed diffraction
                   peaks in E(q) when the diffusion gradients are
                   approximately normal to the tube wall, but their sudden
                   disappearance when the gradient orientation possesses a
                   small axial component. The model also successfully
                   predicts the dependence of E(q) on gradient pulse
                   duration and on gradient strength as well as tube inner
                   diameter. To account for the deviation from the narrow
                   pulse approximation in the PGSTE sequence, we use
                   Callaghan’s matrix operator framework, which this study
                   validates experimentally for the first time. We also
                   show how to combine average propagators derived for
                   classical one-dimensional and two-dimensional models of
                   restricted diffusion (e.g. between plates, within
                   cylinders) to construct composite three-dimensional
                   models of diffusion in complex media containing pores
                   (e.g. rectangular prisms and/ or capped cylinders)
                   having a distribution of orientations, sizes, and
                   aspect ratios. This three-dimensional modeling
                   framework should aid in describing diffusion in
                   numerous biological systems and in a myriad of
                   materials sciences applications.},

                   quantifying streamline-based diffusion fiber tracking
                   methods in terms of probability of connection between
                   points and/or regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
                   commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit
                   the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal
                   direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel.
                   Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte
                   Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty
                   generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty
                   is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion
                   orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in
                   terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two
                   candidates for describing the uncertainty in the
                   diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability
                   of connection to chosen start points or regions are
                   generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The
                   methods presented provide a generic framework for
                   utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic

                   imaging (fMRI). However, the cause of the detected
                   activity relies on the anatomy. Diffusion tensor
                   magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) as a noninvasive
                   modality providing in vivo anatomical information
                   allows determining neural fiber connections which leads
                   to brain mapping. Still a complete map of fiber paths
                   representing the human brain is missing in literature.
                   One of the main drawbacks of reliable fiber mapping is
                   the correct detection of the orientation of multiple
                   fibers within a single imaging voxel. In this study a
                   method based on linear data structures is proposed to
                   define the fiber paths regarding their diffusivity.
                   Another advantage of the proposed method is that the
                   analysis is applied on entire brain diffusion tensor
                   data. The implementation results are promising, so that

                   (1993) Nature (London) 361, 109-110]. Detailed
                   connectivities have been studied in animals through
                   invasive tracer techniques, but these invasive studies
                   cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot
                   always be extrapolated to human systems. We have
                   developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use
                   in living humans, utilizing the unique ability of MRI
                   to characterize water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber
                   trajectories throughout the brain by tracking the
                   direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction)
                   from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks
                   that join anatomically or functionally (functional MRI)
                   defined regions. We demonstrate diffusion tracking of
                   fiber bundles in a variety of white matter classes with
                   examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine,
                   and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered
                   long distances, navigated through divergences and tight
                   curves, and manifested topological separations in the
                   geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer studies
                   in animals and retinotopy studies in humans.
                   Additionally, previously undescribed topologies were
                   revealed in the other pathways. This approach enhances
                   the power of modern imaging by enabling study of fiber
                   connections among anatomically and functionally defined
                   brain regions in individual human subjects.},

                   tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed
                   information about multidirectional fiber architecture
                   within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber
                   tractography results in locations where fiber bundles
                   cross each other. This may lead to the inability to
                   visualize clinically important tracts such as the
                   lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this
                   report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended
                   Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which
                   successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers.
                   We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human
                   brain data, comparing the results with the traditional
                   single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography
                   technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and
                   correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both
                   healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we
                   demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline
                   tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles
                   consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by
                   conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared
                   to the dense connectivity maps generated by
                   probabilistic tractography, the method is
                   computationally efficient and generates discrete
                   geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and
                   clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter
                   pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of
                   functionally relevant white matter areas.},

                   imaging modalities are used for their delineation in
                   living subjects, but these methods rely on subject
                   cooperation, and many regions of the human brain cannot
                   be activated specifically. Diffusion tractography is a
                   novel tool to identify such areas in the human brain,
                   utilizing underlying white matter pathways to separate

                   with short gradient durations and imaging times.
                   Although the DW-SSFP signal is well characterized for
                   isotropic, Gaussian diffusion, it is unclear how the
                   DW-SSFP signal propagates in inhomogeneous media such

                   accommodates Gaussian and non-Gaussian spin

                   perception, and yet why we see them is still the focus
                   of much research. Here we address the question by
                   modelling not human physiology or perception directly
                   as is typically the case but our natural visual world
                   and the need for robust behaviour. Artificial neural
                   networks were trained to predict the reflectance of
                   surfaces in a synthetic ecology consisting of 3-D
                   "dead-leaves" scenes under non-uniform illumination.
                   The networks learned to solve this task accurately and
                   robustly given only ambiguous sense data. In
                   addition--and as a direct consequence of their
                   experience--the networks also made systematic "errors"
                   in their behaviour commensurate with human illusions,
                   which includes brightness contrast and
                   assimilation--although assimilation (specifically
                   White's illusion) only emerged when the virtual ecology
                   included 3-D, as opposed to 2-D scenes. Subtle
                   variations in these illusions, also found in human
                   perception, were observed, such as the asymmetry of
                   brightness contrast. These data suggest that
                   "illusions" arise in humans because (i) natural stimuli
                   are ambiguous, and (ii) this ambiguity is resolved
                   empirically by encoding the statistical relationship
                   between images and scenes in past visual experience.
                   Since resolving stimulus ambiguity is a challenge faced
                   by all visual systems, a corollary of these findings is
                   that human illusions must be experienced by all visual
                   animals regardless of their particular neural
                   machinery. The data also provide a more formal
                   definition of illusion: the condition in which the true
                   source of a stimulus differs from what is its most
                   likely (and thus perceived) source. As such, illusions
                   are not fundamentally different from non-illusory
                   percepts, all being direct manifestations of the
                   statistical relationship between images and scenes.},

                   based on dense transformations requires the setting of
                   many parameters, mainly for regularization. This task
                   is a major issue, as the global quality of the
                   registration will depend on it. Setting these
                   parameters is, however, very hard, and they may have to
                   be tuned for each patient when processing data acquired
                   by different centers or using different protocols.
                   Thus, we present in this article a method to introduce
                   more coherence in the registration by using fewer
                   degrees of freedom than with a dense registration. This
                   is done by registering the images only on user-defined
                   areas, using a set of affine transformations, which are
                   optimized together in a very efficient manner. Our
                   framework also ensures a smooth and coherent
                   transformation thanks to a new regularization of the
                   affine components. Finally, we ensure an invertible
                   transformation thanks to the Log-Euclidean polyaffine
                   framework. This allows us to get a more robust and very
                   efficient registration method, while obtaining good
                   results as explained below. We performed a qualitative
                   and quantitative evaluation of the obtained results on
                   two applications: first on atlas-based brain
                   segmentation, comparing our results with a dense
                   registration algorithm. Then the second application for
                   which our framework is particularly well suited
                   concerns bone registration in the lower-abdomen area.
                   We obtain in this case a better positioning of the
                   femoral heads than with a dense registration. For both
                   applications, we show a significant improvement in
                   computation time, which is crucial for clinical

                   can be employed to study white matter microstructure by
                   examing the 3D displacement profile of water molecules
                   in brain tissue. By applying diffusion-sensitizing
                   gradients along a minimum of 6 directions, second-order
                   tensors can be computed to model dominant diffusion
                   processes. However, it has been shown that conventional
                   DTI is not sufficient to resolve crossing fiber tracts.
                   More recently, High Angular Resolution Diffusion
                   Imaging (HARDI) seeks to address this issue by
                   employing more than 6 gradient directions. In this
                   paper, we introduce the Tensor Distribution Function
                   (TDF), a probability function defined on the space of
                   symmetric and positive definite matrices. Here, fiber
                   crossing is modeled as an ensemble of Gaussian
                   diffusion processes with weights specified by the TDF.
                   Once this optimal TDF is determined, ODF can easily be
                   computed by analytic integration of the resulting
                   displacement probability function. Moreover, principal
                   fiber directions can also be directly derived from the
                   TDF.},

                   can create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR
                   images. These images, acquired by measuring the
                   attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally
                   dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be
                   useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke
                   and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents
                   an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence
                   that displays less distortion and consequently improves
                   image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse
                   provides better image quality with less distortion at
                   no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and
                   allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By
                   adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy
                   currents with a single exponential decay constant can
                   be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay
                   constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is
                   demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion

                   connectivity maps of the neural networks in the human

                   be developed to turn DTI tractography into a
                   practically useful tool. To this end, we have developed
                   a suite of image-processing tools for fiber

                   neuropsychiatric conditions without identifiable focal

                   extracting the abnormal components from the clinical
                   EEG. The approach involves the use of a set a spatial
                   patterns which are common to recorded and 'normal' EEGs
                   and which can account for maximally different
                   proportions of the combined variances in both EEGs.
                   These spatial factors are used to decompose the EEG
                   into orthogonal temporal wave forms which can be judged
                   by the expert electroencephalographer to be abnormal,
                   normal or of artifactual origin. The original EEG is
                   then reconstructed using only the abnormal components
                   and principal component analysis is used to present the
                   spatial topography of the abnormal components. The
                   effectiveness of the method is discussed along with its
                   value for localization of abnormal sources. It is
                   suggested, in conclusion, that the approach described
                   may be optimal for interpretation of the clinical EEG
                   since it allows what is best in terms of quantitative
                   analysis of the EEG to be combined with the best that

                   demonstrate that our atlas creation method, which is
                   based on group spectral clustering of tractography,
                   discovers structures corresponding to expected white
                   matter anatomy such as the corpus callosum, uncinate
                   fasciculus, cingulum bundles, arcuate fasciculus, and
                   corona radiata. The white matter clusters are augmented
                   with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type
                   of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter
                   atlas. We then show how to perform automatic
                   segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by
                   extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in
                   the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results
                   regarding the stability of our method and parameter
                   choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation
                   and automatic segmentation experiment. We demonstrate

                   patterns of white matter connectivity in the human
                   brain. In this study, the behavior of an algorithm for
                   white matter tractography is examined. The algorithm,
                   called TEND, uses the entire diffusion tensor to
                   deflect the estimated fiber trajectory. Simulations and
                   imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were
                   performed to investigate the behavior of the
                   tractography algorithm. The simulations show that the
                   deflection term is less sensitive than the major
                   eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging
                   experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus
                   callosum, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona
                   radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior
                   longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus,

                   mapping the organizational patterns of white matter in
                   the human brain as well as mapping the relationship

  abstract       = {MRI tractography is the mapping of neural fiber
                   pathways based on diffusion MRI of tissue diffusion
                   anisotropy. Tractography based on diffusion tensor
                   imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber
                   orientations within a single voxel. To address this
                   limitation, diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) and related
                   methods were developed to image complex distributions
                   of intravoxel fiber orientation. Here we demonstrate
                   that tractography based on DSI has the capacity to
                   image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was
                   performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and
                   in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract
                   solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure,
                   following directions of maximum diffusion at every
                   point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization
                   environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography
                   accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in
                   optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber
                   intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar
                   folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber
                   architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of
                   these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure
                   was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets.
                   These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able
                   to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential
                   step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional

                   fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack
                   of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical
                   limitations of alternative methods and physical models
                   have meant that numerical simulations have become the
                   method of choice in practice. However, previous
                   numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres
                   embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not
                   capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper
                   we describe a method that is able to randomly generate
                   numerical structures consisting of densely packed
                   bundles of fibres, which are much more representative
                   of human white matter, and simulate the DW-MR images
                   that would arise from them under many imaging
                   conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to
                   produce structures with a range of complexities that
                   spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These
                   structures are shown to contain many different features
                   that occur in human white matter and which could
                   confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract
                   kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such
                   features can be sampled by the random generation of
                   many different structures with consistent levels of
                   complexity. The proposed software provides means for
                   quantitative assessment via direct comparison between
                   tracking results and the exact location of the
                   generated fibres. This should greatly improve our
                   understanding of algorithm performance and therefore
                   prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},

  abstract       = {This paper exploits the idea that each individual
                   brain region has a specific connection profile to
                   create parcellations of the cortical mantle using MR
                   diffusion imaging. The parcellation is performed in two
                   steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a
                   macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus
                   recognition system. Then, for each voxel of the cortex,
                   a connection profile is computed using a probabilistic
                   tractography framework. The tractography is performed
                   from q fields using regularized particle trajectories.
                   Fiber ODF are inferred from the q-balls using a
                   sharpening process focusing the weight around the
                   q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of
                   propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly
                   aligned with the diffusion data prevents the particles
                   from crossing the cortical folds. During propagation,
                   the particles father child particles in order to
                   improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each
                   voxel, intersection of the particle trajectories with

                   tensor and its scalar invariants. The standard

                   diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging dataset,
                   locates the fiber bundles in the human brain. Because
                   it is a computationally expensive process, the
                   interactivity of current fiber tracking tools is
                   limited. We propose a new approach, which we termed
                   real-time interactive fiber tracking, which aims at
                   providing a rich and intuitive environment for the
                   neuroradiologist. In this approach, fiber tracking is
                   executed automatically every time the user acts upon
                   the application. Particularly, when the volume of
                   interest from which fiber trajectories are calculated
                   is moved on the screen, fiber tracking is executed,
                   even while it is being moved. We present our fiber
                   tracking tool, which implements the real-time fiber
                   tracking concept by using the video card's graphics
                   processing units to execute the fiber tracking
                   algorithm. Results show that real-time interactive
                   fiber tracking is feasible on computers equipped with
                   common, low-cost video cards.},

                   increasing role in neuroscientific applications of
                   diffusion tensor imaging, and the most popular method
                   for building them is fiber tractography. For some
                   analysis tasks, however, a compelling alternative may
                   be found in the first and second derivatives of
                   diffusion anisotropy. We extend to tensor fields the
                   notion from classical computer vision of ridges and
                   valleys, and define anisotropy creases as features of
                   locally extremal tensor anisotropy. Mathematically,
                   these are the loci where the gradient of anisotropy is
                   orthogonal to one or more eigenvectors of its Hessian.
                   We propose that anisotropy creases provide a basis for
                   extracting a skeleton of the major white matter
                   pathways, in that ridges of anisotropy coincide with
                   interiors of fiber tracts, and valleys of anisotropy
                   coincide with the interfaces between adjacent but
                   distinctly oriented tracts. The crease extraction
                   algorithm we present generates high-quality polygonal
                   models of crease surfaces, which are further simplified
                   by connected-component analysis. We demonstrate
                   anisotropy creases on measured diffusion MRI data, and
                   visualize them in combination with tractography to
                   confirm their anatomic relevance.},

                   extracting the abnormal components from the clinical
                   EEG. The approach involves the use of a set a spatial
                   patterns which are common to recorded and 'normal' EEGs
                   and which can account for maximally different
                   proportions of the combined variances in both EEGs.
                   These spatial factors are used to decompose the EEG
                   into orthogonal temporal wave forms which can be judged
                   by the expert electroencephalographer to be abnormal,
                   normal or of artifactual origin. The original EEG is
                   then reconstructed using only the abnormal components
                   and principal component analysis is used to present the
                   spatial topography of the abnormal components. The
                   effectiveness of the method is discussed along with its
                   value for localization of abnormal sources. It is
                   suggested, in conclusion, that the approach described
                   may be optimal for interpretation of the clinical EEG
                   since it allows what is best in terms of quantitative

                   Carlo simulation framework for diffusing spins that
                   generates realistic synthetic data for diffusion
                   magnetic resonance imaging. Similar systems in the
                   literature consider only simple substrates and their
                   authors do not consider convergence and parameter
                   optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo
                   simulations within complex irregular substrates. We
                   compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an
                   analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess
                   precision and accuracy of the generated results. We
                   obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for
                   a given run time by trading off number of updates in
                   favor of number of spins such that precision and
                   accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further
                   experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue
                   environment that current analytic models cannot
                   capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling,
                   abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction
                   in the extracellular space due to the effects of
                   abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the
                   predictions of the analytical model, which does not
                   capture these effects. This swelling-induced
                   restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining
                   the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in
                   the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

                   imaging (MRI), which samples the Fourier transform of
                   the probability density function of particle
                   displacements. The PAS is then a representation of the
                   relative mobility of particles in each direction. In
                   PAS-MRI, we compute the PAS in each voxel of an image.

                   human brain data and on synthetic data. The human brain

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite its potential for
                   visualizing white matter fiber tracts in vivo,
                   diffusion tensor tractography has found only limited
                   applications in clinical research in which specific
                   anatomic connections between distant regions need to be
                   evaluated. We introduce a robust method for fiber
                   clustering that guides the separation of anatomically
                   distinct fiber tracts and enables further estimation of
                   anatomic connectivity between distant brain regions.
                   METHODS: Line scanning diffusion tensor images (LSDTI)
                   were acquired on a 1.5T magnet. Regions of interest for
                   several anatomically distinct fiber tracts were
                   manually drawn; then, white matter tractography was
                   performed by using the Runge-Kutta method to
                   interpolate paths (fiber traces) following the major
                   directions of diffusion, in which traces were seeded
                   only within the defined regions of interest. Next, a
                   fully automatic procedure was applied to fiber traces,
                   grouping them according to a pairwise similarity
                   function that takes into account the shapes of the
                   fibers and their spatial locations. RESULTS: We
                   demonstrated the ability of the clustering algorithm to
                   separate several fiber tracts which are otherwise
                   difficult to define (left and right fornix, uncinate
                   fasciculus and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and
                   corpus callosum fibers). CONCLUSION: This method
                   successfully delineates fiber tracts that can be
                   further analyzed for clinical research purposes.
                   Hypotheses regarding specific fiber connections and
                   their abnormalities in various neuropsychiatric
                   disorders can now be tested.},

  abstract       = {This paper exploits the idea that each individual
                   brain region has a specific connection profile to
                   create parcellations of the cortical mantle using MR
                   diffusion imaging. The parcellation is performed in two
                   steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a
                   macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus
                   recognition system. Then, for each voxel of the cortex,
                   a connection profile is computed using a probabilistic
                   tractography framework. The tractography is performed
                   from q fields using regularized particle trajectories.
                   Fiber ODF are inferred from the q-balls using a
                   sharpening process focusing the weight around the
                   q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of
                   propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly
                   aligned with the diffusion data prevents the particles
                   from crossing the cortical folds. During propagation,
                   the particles father child particles in order to
                   improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each
                   voxel, intersection of the particle trajectories with
                   the gyri lead to a connectivity profile made up of only

                   from diffusion-weighted MR data rely on a tensor model.
                   However, the tensor model can only resolve a single
                   fiber orientation within each imaging voxel. New
                   emerging approaches have been proposed to obtain a
                   better representation of the diffusion process
                   occurring in fiber crossing. In this paper, we adapt a
                   tracking algorithm to the q-ball representation, which
                   results from a spherical Radon transform of high
                   angular resolution data. This algorithm is based on a
                   Monte-Carlo strategy, using regularized particle
                   trajectories to sample the white matter geometry. The
                   method is validated using a phantom of bundle crossing
                   made up of haemodialysis fibers. The method is also
                   applied to the detection of the auditory tract in three

  abstract       = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information
                   about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that
                   potentially can be used to study human brain
                   connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques.
                   Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to
                   extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in
                   regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The
                   spherical deconvolution technique has recently been
                   proposed to address this limitation. It provides an
                   estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by
                   assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle
                   is adequately described by a single response function.
                   However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and
                   susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to
                   introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD,
                   which are clearly physically impossible. In this study,
                   the introduction of a constraint on such negative
                   regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the
                   spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to
                   provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst
                   preserving angular resolution. The approach also
                   permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD
                   parameters are estimated than were actually measured,
                   improving the angular resolution of the results. The
                   method provides much better defined fibre orientation
                   estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that
                   are separated by smaller angles than previously
                   possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to
                   be designed that are able to track reliably through
                   crossing fibre regions.},

                   describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on
                   the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF)
                   estimated from high angular resolution diffusion
                   imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform
                   accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a
                   fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use
                   a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening
                   deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF
                   reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT
                   provides new insight into the relationship between the
                   HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We
                   demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical
                   spherical deconvolution and improves the angular
                   resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of
                   this paper is the development of new deterministic and
                   new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the
                   full multidirectional information obtained through use
                   of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is
                   performed on human brain datasets comparing our new
                   deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in
                   complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an
                   application of our new probabilistic tracking, we
                   quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres
                   intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior
                   longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects.
                   Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based
                   methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to

                   demonstrate that unlike the commonly used ROI-based
                   methods for population studies, our technique is
                   sensitive to the local variation of diffusivity
                   parameters along the fiber tracts. We show the strength
                   of the proposed approach in identifying the differences
                   in schizophrenic data compared to controls.
                   Statistically significant drops in fractional
                   anisotropy are observed along the genu and bilaterally

  abstract       = {We present a novel approach for joint clustering and
                   point-by-point mapping of white matter fiber pathways.
                   Knowledge of the point correspondence along the fiber
                   pathways is not only necessary for accurate clustering
                   of the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also
                   crucial for any tract-oriented quantitative analysis.
                   We employ an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to
                   cluster the trajectories in a gamma mixture model
                   context. The result of clustering is the probabilistic
                   assignment of the fiber trajectories to each cluster,
                   an estimate of the cluster parameters, i.e. spatial
                   mean and variance, and point correspondences. The fiber
                   bundles are modeled by the mean trajectory and its
                   spatial variation. Point-by-point correspondence of the
                   trajectories within a bundle is obtained by
                   constructing a distance map and a label map from each
                   cluster center at every iteration of the EM algorithm.
                   This offers a time-efficient alternative to pairwise
                   curve matching of all trajectories with respect to each
                   cluster center. The proposed method has the potential
                   to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber tracts by
                   incorporating it as prior information in the EM
                   algorithm. The algorithm is also capable of handling
                   outliers in a principled way. The presented results
                   confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the
                   proposed framework for quantitative analysis of
                   diffusion tensor MRI.},

                   valuable tool used for inferring structural anisotropy
                   of brain white matter connectivity from diffusion
                   tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular
                   resolution diffusion models were introduced in order to
                   overcome the inadequacy of the tensor model for
                   describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among
                   them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space
                   method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing
                   a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR
                   signal and the orientation distribution function (ODF).
                   Experimental validation of these methods in a model
                   system is necessary to determine the accuracy of the
                   methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made
                   up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter
                   to axons) bundles, crossing at $90^o$, was designed and
                   dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical
                   scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions
                   of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal
                   configurations of underlying structures.
                   Threedimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal
                   shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population
                   and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the
                   crossing area. Principal orientations were estimated
                   from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural
                   fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for
                   depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions,
                   QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of $19^o$
                   and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of
                   $30^o$.},

  abstract       = {OBJECTIVES: The spatio-temporal decomposition (STD)
                   approach was used to localize the sources of simulated
                   electroencephalograms (EEGs) to gain experience with
                   the approach for analyzing real data. METHODS: The STD
                   approach used is similar to the multiple signal
                   classification method (MUSIC) in that it requires the
                   signal subspace containing the sources of interest to
                   be isolated in the EEG measurement space. It is
                   different from MUSIC in that it allows more general
                   methods of spatio-temporal decomposition to be used
                   that may be better suited to the background EEG.
                   RESULTS: If the EEG data matrix is not corrupted by
                   noise, the STD approach can be used to locate multiple
                   dipole sources of the EEG one at a time without a
                   priori knowledge of the number of active sources in the
                   signal space. In addition, the common-spatial-patterns
                   method of spatio-temporal decomposition is superior to
                   the eigenvector decomposition for localizing activity
                   that is ictal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: The STD approach
                   appears to be able to provide a means of localizing the
                   equivalent dipole sources of realistic brain sources
                   and that, even under difficult noise conditions and
                   only 2 or 3 s of available EEG, the precision of the
                   localization can be as low as a few mm.},

                   subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward
                   and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution
                   images from all the subjects in the study into the same
                   stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the

                   smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise
                   parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed
                   gray-matter images from the two groups are performed.

                   is presented. Accurate clustering of the trajectories
                   into fiber bundles requires point correspondence
                   determined along the fiber pathways. This knowledge is
                   also crucial for any tract-oriented quantitative
                   analysis. We employ an expectation-maximization (EM)
                   algorithm to cluster the trajectories in a Gamma
                   mixture model context. The result of clustering is the
                   probabilistic assignment of the fiber trajectories to
                   each cluster, an estimate of the cluster parameters,
                   and point correspondences along the trajectories.
                   Point-by-point correspondence of the trajectories
                   within a bundle is obtained by constructing a distance
                   map and a label map from each cluster center at every
                   iteration of the EM algorithm. This offers a
                   time-efficient alternative to pairwise curve matching

                   resonance diffusion imaging to provide information
                   about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by
                   measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white
                   matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly
                   derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy
                   (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the
                   local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
                   starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical
                   analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to
                   development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal
                   analysis is compromised by the use of standard
                   registration algorithms; there has not to date been a
                   satisfactory solution to the question of how to align
                   FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows
                   for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent
                   voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of
                   the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been
                   resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that
                   aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned
                   non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection
                   onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
                   ‘‘mean FA skeleton’’). We refer to this new approach as
                   Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to
                   improve the sensitivity, objectivity and
                   interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion
                   imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present
                   example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging
                   studies.},

                   imaging method that can be used to measure local
                   information about the structure of white matter within
                   the human brain. Combining DTI data with the
                   computational methods of MR tractography,
                   neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of
                   nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course
                   through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used
                   visualization techniques to better understand
                   tractography data, but they often struggle with the
                   abundance and complexity of the pathways. In this
                   paper, we describe a novel set of interaction
                   techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret
                   such pathways. Specifically, our application allows
                   neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate
                   box or ellipsoid-shaped regions to selectively display
                   pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas.
                   These regions can be used in coordination with a simple
                   and flexible query language which allows for arbitrary
                   combinations of these queries using Boolean logic
                   operators. A representation of the cortical surface is
                   provided for specifying queries of pathways that may be
                   relevant to gray matter structures and for displaying
                   activation information obtained from functional
                   magnetic resonance imaging. By precomputing the
                   pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain
                   the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer
                   sessions with brain researchers. We survey some
                   questions that researchers have been asking about
                   tractography data and show how our system can be used
                   to answer these questions efficiently.},

                   analysis of diffusion MRI data along white matter fiber
                   tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle
                   segmentations, we generate an arc length
                   parameterization of the bundle with point
                   correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
                   allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this
                   paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber
                   coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce
                   an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial
                   distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject
                   variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for
                   generating arc length correspondences across
                   hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric
                   diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF)
                   and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study
                   demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may
                   not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in
                   entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD)
                   differences found in AF. We report TBM results of
                   higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left
                   hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3),
                   the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the
                   left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related
                   to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the
                   diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the
                   significance levels onto the tractography trajectories
                   for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical
                   locations of the interhemispheric differences. The TBM
                   approach brings analysis of DTI data into the
                   clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of
                   the tract anatomy.},

                   and analysis of densely sampled 3D DTI fibers in
                   biological specimens, due to the high geometric,
                   spatial, and anatomical complexity of fiber tracts.
                   Previous methods for DTI fiber visualization use
                   zooming, color-mapping, selection, and abstraction to
                   deliver the characteristics of the fibers. However,
                   these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of
                   visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and
                   occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers
                   difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction
                   method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D
                   representation containing a low-dimensional embedding
                   of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the
                   relationship between the fibers and removes the visual
                   clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the
                   fibers. This new interface allows the user to
                   manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D
                   embedded points and easily compare or validate his or
                   her results in both domains. The implementation of the
                   framework is GPU based to achieve real-time
                   interaction. The framework was applied to several
                   tasks, and the results show that our method reduces the
                   user's workload in recognizing 3D DTI fibers and
                   permits quick and accurate DTI fiber selection.},

                   neonates for regional and age-related differences in
                   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
                   anisotropy (FA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight healthy
                   adults and 20 healthy neonates were examined with a
                   3.0-T head-only magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit by
                   using a single-shot diffusion-tensor sequence. Trace
                   ADC maps, FA maps, directional maps of the putative
                   directions of white matter (WM) tracts, and
                   fiber-tracking maps were obtained. Regions of
                   interest-eight in WM and one in gray matter (GM)-were
                   predefined for the ADC and FA measurements. The Student
                   t test was used to compare FA and ADC between adults
                   and neonates, whereas the Tukey multiple-comparison
                   test was used to compare FA and ADC in different brain
                   regions in the adult and neonate groups. RESULTS: A
                   global elevation in ADC (P <.001) in both GM and WM and
                   a reduction in FA (P <.001) in WM were observed in
                   neonates as compared with these values in adults. In
                   addition, significant regional variations in FA and ADC
                   were observed in both groups. Regional variations in FA
                   and ADC were less remarkable in adults, whereas
                   neonates had consistently higher FA values and lower
                   ADC values in the central WM as compared with these
                   values in the peripheral WM. Fiber tracking revealed
                   only major WM tracts in the neonates but fibers
                   extending to the peripheral WM in the adults.
                   CONCLUSION: There were regional differences in FA and
                   ADC values in the neonates; such variations were less
                   remarkable in the adults.},

                   visualize organization of white matter fibre tracts in
                   vivo. DTI is a relatively new imaging technique, and
                   new tools developed for quantifying fibre tracts
                   require evaluation. The purpose of this study was to
                   compare the reliability of a novel clustering approach
                   with a multiple region of interest (MROI) approach in
                   both healthy and disease (schizophrenia) populations.
                   DTI images were acquired in 20 participants (n=10
                   patients with schizophrenia: 56+/-15 years; n=10
                   controls: 51+/-20 years) (1.5 T GE system) with
                   diffusion gradients applied in 23 non-collinear
                   directions, repeated three times. Whole brain seeding
                   and creation of fibre tracts were then performed.
                   Interrater reliability of the clustering approach, and
                   the MROI approach, were each evaluated and the methods
                   compared. There was high spatial (voxel-based)
                   agreement within and between the clustering and MROI
                   methods. Fractional anisotropy, trace, and radial and
                   axial diffusivity values showed high intraclass
                   correlation (p<0.001 for all tracts) for each approach.
                   Differences in scalar indices of diffusion between the
                   clustering and MROI approach were minimal. The
                   excellent interrater reliability of the clustering
                   method and high agreement with the MROI method,
                   quantitatively and spatially, indicates that the
                   clustering method can be used with confidence. The
                   clustering method avoids biases of ROI drawing and
                   placement, and, not limited by a priori predictions,
                   may be a more robust and efficient way to identify and
                   measure white matter tracts of interest.},

                   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Confocal microscopy,
                   Electron Microscopy (EM) or Selective Plane
                   Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) yield three-dimensional
                   (3D) data sets in need of appropriate computational
                   methods for their analysis. The reconstruction,
                   segmentation and registration are best approached from
                   the 3D representation of the data set. RESULTS: Here we
                   present a platform-independent framework based on Java
                   and Java 3D for accelerated rendering of biological
                   images. Our framework is seamlessly integrated into
                   ImageJ, a free image processing package with a vast
                   collection of community-developed biological image
                   analysis tools. Our framework enriches the ImageJ
                   software libraries with methods that greatly reduce the
                   complexity of developing image analysis tools in an
                   interactive 3D visualization environment. In
                   particular, we provide high-level access to volume
                   rendering, volume editing, surface extraction, and
                   image annotation. The ability to rely on a library that
                   removes the low-level details enables concentrating
                   software development efforts on the algorithm
                   implementation parts. CONCLUSIONS: Our framework
                   enables biomedical image software development to be
                   built with 3D visualization capabilities with very
                   little effort. We offer the source code and convenient

                   variability of a population of white matter fiber
                   bundles without imposing unrealistic geometrical
                   priors. In this respect, modeling fiber bundles as
                   currents seems particularly relevant, as it gives a
                   metric between bundles which relies neither on point
                   nor on fiber correspondences and which is robust to
                   fiber interruption. First, this metric is included in a
                   diffeomorphic registration scheme which consistently
                   aligns sets of fiber bundles. In particular, we show
                   that aligning directly fiber bundles may solve the
                   aperture problem which appears when fiber mappings are
                   constrained by tensors only. Second, the measure of
                   variability of a population of fiber bundles is based
                   on a statistical model which considers every bundle as
                   a random diffeomorphic deformation of a common template
                   plus a random non-diffeomorphic perturbation. Thus, the
                   variability is decomposed into a geometrical part and a
                   "texture" part. Our results on real data show that both
                   parts may contain interesting anatomical features.},

                   powerful tool for the non-invasive depiction of the
                   white matter architecture in the human brain. However,
                   due to limitations in the underlying tensor model, the
                   technique is often unable to reconstruct correct
                   trajectories in heterogeneous fiber arrangements, such
                   as axonal crossings. A novel tractography method based
                   on fast marching (FM) is proposed which is capable of
                   resolving fiber crossings and also permits trajectories
                   to branch. It detects heterogeneous fiber arrangements
                   by incorporating information from the entire diffusion
                   tensor. The FM speed function is adapted to the local
                   tensor characteristics, allowing in particular to
                   maintain the front evolution direction in crossing
                   situations. In addition, the FM's discretization error
                   is reduced by increasing the number of considered
                   possible front evolution directions. The performance of
                   the technique is demonstrated in artificial data and in
                   the healthy human brain. Comparisons with standard FM
                   tractography and conventional line propagation
                   algorithms show that, in the presence of interfering
                   structures, the proposed method is more accurate in
                   reconstructing trajectories. The in vivo results
                   illustrate that the elucidated major white matter
                   pathways are consistent with known anatomy and that
                   multiple crossings and tract branching are handled

                   information. Studies in this field have so far been
                   limited mainly to the correction of miniscule
                   physiological motion. In order to correct for gross
                   patient motion it is not sufficient to correct for
                   misregistration between successive shots; the change in
                   the diffusion-encoding direction must also be accounted
                   for. This becomes particularly important for multishot
                   sequences, whereby—in the presence of motion—each shot
                   is encoded with a different diffusion weighting. In
                   this study a general mathematical framework to correct
                   for gross patient motion present in a multishot and

                   presented that includes the effect of rotational and
                   translational motion in the patient frame of reference.
                   This model was used to create a nonlinear leastsquares
                   formulation, from which the diffusion tensors were
                   obtained using a nonlinear conjugate gradient
                   algorithm. Applications to both phantom simulations and
                   in vivo studies showed that in the case of gross motion

                   Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) and Graph Theory is
                   presented for characterizing the anatomical connections
                   between brain gray matter areas. In a first step, brain
                   voxels are modeled as nodes of a non-directed graph in
                   which the weight of an arc linking two neighbor nodes
                   is assumed to be proportional to the probability of
                   being connected by nervous fibers. This probability is
                   estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation
                   and intravoxel white matter orientational distribution
                   function, obtained from anatomical MRI and DW-MRI,
                   respectively. A new tractography algorithm for finding
                   white matter routes is also introduced. This algorithm
                   solves the most probable path problem between any two
                   nodes, leading to the assessment of probabilistic brain
                   anatomical connection maps. In a second step, for
                   assessing anatomical connectivity between K gray matter
                   structures, the previous graph is redefined as a K+1
                   partite graph by partitioning the initial nodes set in
                   K non-overlapped gray matter subsets and one subset
                   clustering the remaining nodes. Three different
                   measures are proposed for quantifying anatomical
                   connections between any pair of gray matter subsets:
                   Anatomical Connection Strength (ACS), Anatomical
                   Connection Density (ACD) and Anatomical Connection
                   Probability (ACP). This methodology was applied to both
                   artificial and actual human data. Results show that
                   nervous fiber pathways between some regions of interest
                   were reconstructed correctly. Additionally, mean
                   connectivity maps of ACS, ACD and ACP between 71 gray

                   exquisitely sensitive probe of tissue microstructure.
                   Owing to the microscopic length scale of diffusion in
                   biological tissues, diffusion imaging can reveal
                   histological architecture irresolvable by conventional
                   magnetic resonance imaging methods. However, diffusion
                   imaging methods to date have chiefly been based on
                   analytical models of the underlying diffusion process.
                   For example, diffusion tensor imaging assumes
                   homogeneous Gaussian diffusion within each voxel, an
                   assumption which is clearly invalid for the vast
                   majority of the brain at presently achievable voxel
                   resolutions. In this thesis I developed a diffusion
                   imaging method capable of measuring the microscopic
                   diffusion function within each voxel. In contrast to
                   previous approaches to diffusion imaging, the method
                   presented here does not require any assumptions on the
                   underlying diffusion function. The model-independent
                   approach can resolve complex intravoxel tissue
                   structure including fiber crossing and fiber divergence
                   within a single voxel. The method is capable of
                   resolving not only deep white matter intersections, but
                   also composite tissue structure at the cortical margin,
                   and fiber-specific degeneration in neurodegenerative
                   pathology. In sum, the approach can reveal complex
                   intravoxel tissue structure previously thought to be
                   beyond the scope of diffusion imaging methodology.},

                   variability of a population of white matter fiber
                   bundles without imposing unrealistic geometrical
                   priors. In this respect, modeling fiber bundles as
                   currents seems particularly relevant, as it gives a
                   metric between bundles which relies neither on point
                   nor on fiber correspondences and which is robust to
                   fiber interruption. First, this metric is included in a
                   diffeomorphic registration scheme which consistently
                   aligns sets of fiber bundles. In particular, we show
                   that aligning directly fiber bundles may solve the
                   aperture problem which appears when fiber mappings are
                   constrained by tensors only. Second, the measure of
                   variability of a population of fiber bundles is based
                   on a statistical model which considers every bundle as
                   a random diffeomorphic deformation of a common template
                   plus a random non-diffeomorphic perturbation. Thus, the
                   variability is decomposed into a geometrical part and a
                   "texture" part. Our results on real data show that both
                   parts may contain interesting anatomical features.},

                   asymmetry, most likely linked to language has been
                   identified with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using
                   T1-weighted images. Differences in white matter
                   obtained with this technique are less consistent,
                   probably due to the relative insensitivity of the T1
                   contrast to the ultrastructure of white matter.
                   Furthermore, previous VBM studies failed to find
                   differences related to handedness in either grey or
                   white matter. We revisited these issues and
                   investigated two independent groups of subjects with
                   diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) for asymmetries in white
                   matter composition. Using voxel-based statistical
                   analyses an asymmetry of the arcuate fascicle was
                   observed, with higher fractional anisotropy in the left

                   handedness in the white matter underneath the
                   precentral gyrus contralateral to the dominant hand.
                   Remarkably, these findings were very robust, even when

                   the sensitivity of DTI for white matter tissue

                   porous structures via diffusion MRI data. In line with
                   these previous works, this article provides a detailed
                   mathematical description of q-space in spherical
                   coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and
                   similarities between various related q-space
                   methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging
                   (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion
                   orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation
                   provides a direct relationship between the orientation
                   distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data
                   without using any approximation. Under this
                   relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of
                   the Radon transform of the radial projection (in
                   q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new
                   methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was
                   put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in
                   terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining
                   model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work
                   provides a new framework for combining information
                   coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple
                   spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging
                   encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a
                   high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more
                   efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for
                   obtaining better ODF estimates.},

                   matter tracts are described. The protocols were refined

                   protocols was then tested by raters who did not have
                   previous experience in tractography. The protocols were
                   applied to a DTI database of adult normal subjects to
                   study size, fractional anisotropy (FA), and T2 of
                   individual white matter tracts. Distinctive features in
                   FA and T2 were found for the corticospinal tract and

                   the size of white matter tracts projecting to the
                   temporal lobe. This protocol provides guidelines for

                   for diffusion MRI can estimate multiple dominant fibre
                   orientations within a single imaging voxel, they are
                   fundamentally limited in certain cases of complex
                   subvoxel fibre structures, resulting in ambiguous local
                   orientation distribution functions. In this article we
                   address the important problem of disambiguating such
                   complex subvoxel fibre tract configurations, with the
                   purpose of improving the performance of fibre
                   tractography. We do so by extending a curve inference
                   method to distinguish between the cases of curving and
                   fanning fibre bundles using differential geometric
                   estimates in a local neighbourhood. The key benefit of
                   this method is the inference of curves, instead of only
                   fibre orientations, to model the underlying fibre
                   bundles. This in turn allows distinct fibre geometries
                   that contain nearly identical sets of fibre
                   orientations at a voxel, to be distinguished from one
                   another. Experimental results demonstrate the ability
                   of the method to successfully label voxels into one of
                   the above categories and improve the performance of a
                   fibre-tracking algorithm.},

                   made it possible to reveal white matter anatomy and to
                   detect neurological abnormalities in children. However,
                   the clinical use of this technique is hampered by the
                   lack of a normal standard of reference. The goal of
                   this study was to initiate the establishment of a
                   database of DTI images in children, which can be used
                   as a normal standard of reference for diagnosis of
                   pediatric neurological abnormalities. Seven pediatric
                   volunteers and 23 pediatric patients (age range: 0-54
                   months) referred for clinical MR examinations, but
                   whose brains were shown to be normal, underwent
                   anatomical and DTI acquisitions on a 1.5 T MR scanner.
                   The white matter maturation, as observed on DTI color
                   maps, was described and illustrated. Changes in
                   diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA), average apparent
                   diffusion constant (ADCave), and T2-weighted (T2W)
                   signal intensity were quantified in 12 locations to
                   characterize the anatomical variability of the
                   maturation process. Almost all prominent white matter
                   tracts could be identified from birth, although their
                   anisotropy was often low. The evolution of FA, shape,
                   and size of the white matter tracts comprised generally
                   three phases: rapid changes during the first 12 months;
                   slow modifications during the second year; and relative
                   stability after 24 months. The time courses of FA,
                   ADCave, and T2W signal intensity confirmed our visual
                   observations that maturation of the white matter and
                   the normality of its architecture can be assessed with
                   DTI in young children. The database is available online
                   and is expected to foster the use of this promising
                   technique in the diagnosis of pediatric pathologies.},

                   of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was
                   validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus
                   callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were
                   constructed and found to be consistent with known
                   anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades
                   where the distribution of fiber tract directions is
                   nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in
                   diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory
                   to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can
                   provide quantitative information with which to
                   visualize and study connectivity and continuity of
                   neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous
                   systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating
                   architectural features in other fibrous tissues and

                   commonly measured only the mean value of a scalar
                   invariant such as the fractional anisotropy (FA),
                   ignoring the spatial variation of FA along the length

                   analysis of diffusion MRI data in an anatomical

                   automatic generation of white matter tract arc length
                   parameterizations, based on learning a fiber bundle
                   model from tractography from multiple subjects. Our
                   tract-based coordinate system enables TBM for the

                   subjects. We present example TBM results from a study

                   registration of white matter tractographies extracted
                   from diffusion tensor-magnetic resonance imaging scans.
                   The fibers are projected into a high dimensional
                   feature space based on the sequence of their 3-D
                   coordinates. Adaptive mean-shift clustering is applied
                   to extract a compact set of representative fiber-modes
                   (FM). Each FM is assigned to a multivariate Gaussian
                   distribution according to its population thereby
                   leading to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
                   representation for the entire set of fibers. The
                   registration between two fiber sets is treated as the
                   alignment of two GMMs and is performed by maximizing
                   their correlation ratio. A nine-parameters affine
                   transform is recovered and eventually refined to a
                   twelve-parameters affine transform using an innovative
                   mean-shift based registration refinement scheme
                   presented in this paper. The validation of the
                   algorithm on synthetic intrasubject data demonstrates
                   its robustness to interrupted and deviating fiber
                   artifacts as well as outliers. Using real intrasubject
                   data, a comparison is conducted to other intensity
                   based and fiber-based registration algorithms,
                   demonstrating competitive results. An option for
                   tracking-in-time, on specific white matter fiber
                   tracts, is also demonstrated on the real data.},

                   toward one another in that we often take pleasure in
                   seeing others succeed. This fact is almost certainly
                   exploited by game shows, yet why watching others win
                   elicits a pleasurable vicarious rewarding feeling in
                   the absence of personal economic gain is unclear. One
                   explanation is that game shows use contestants who have
                   similarities to the viewing population, thereby
                   kindling kin-motivated responses (for example,
                   prosocial behavior). Using a game show-inspired
                   paradigm, we show that the interactions between the
                   ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex subserve
                   the modulation of vicarious reward by similarity,
                   respectively. Our results support studies showing that
                   similarity acts as a proximate neurobiological
                   mechanism where prosocial behavior extends to unrelated

                   visualizing white matter tracts in the human brain in
                   vivo is white matter fiber tractography that uses
                   magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. The
                   success of this method depends strongly on the
                   capability of the applied tracking algorithm and the
                   quality of the underlying data set. However, DTI-based
                   fiber tractography still lacks standardized validation.
                   In the present work, a combined fMRI/DTI study was
                   performed, both to develop a setup for verifying fiber
                   tracking results using fMRI-derived functional
                   connections and to explore the limitations of fMRI
                   based DTI fiber tracking. Therefore, a minor fiber
                   bundle that features several fiber crossings and
                   intersections was examined: The striatum and its
                   connections to the primary motor cortex were examined
                   by using two approaches to derive the somatotopic
                   organization of the striatum. First, an fMRI-based
                   somatotopic map of the striatum was reconstructed,
                   based on fMRI activations that were provoked by
                   unilateral motor tasks. Second, fMRI-guided DTI fiber
                   tracking was performed to generate DTI-based
                   somatotopic maps, using a standard line propagation and
                   an advanced fast marching algorithm. The results show
                   that the fiber connections reconstructed by the
                   advanced fast marching algorithm are in good agreement
                   with known anatomy, and that the DTI-revealed
                   somatotopy is similar to the fMRI somatotopy.
                   Furthermore, the study illustrates that the combination
                   of fMRI with DTI can supply additional information in
                   order to choose reasonable seed regions for generating
                   functionally relevant networks and to validate
                   reconstructed fibers.},

                   distortion due to field gradient eddy currents can
                   create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR images.
                   These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of
                   NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion,
                   have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis
                   and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue
                   structure. This work presents an improvement on the
                   spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less
                   distortion and consequently improves image quality.
                   Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image
                   quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning
                   efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible
                   diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of
                   the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single
                   exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy
                   currents with similar decay constants can be greatly
                   reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom
                   measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of
                   normal human brain. Magn Reson Med 49:177-182, 2003. ©

                   trajectories of major white matter bundles. By
                   combining the identified tract coordinates with various
                   types of MR parameter maps, such as T2 and diffusion
                   properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis of
                   these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract
                   reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume
                   effects, and complicated axonal structures.
                   Furthermore, changes in diffusion anisotropy under
                   pathological conditions could alter the results of 3D
                   tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white

                   can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a
                   voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned.
                   However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of
                   fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel
                   fiber crossing. The present study sought to test
                   whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient
                   sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber
                   orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber
                   crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local
                   maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient
                   orientation, indicating the presence of multiple
                   intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the
                   observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor
                   reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was
                   modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian
                   diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the
                   underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a

                   application field originate from diffusion tensor
                   imaging (DTI), a powerful nuclear magnetic resonance
                   technique which enables the quantification of
                   microscopical tissue properties. The current analysis
                   framework of separate voxelwise regressions is
                   reformulated as a 3D space-varying coefficient model
                   (SVCM) for the entire set of diffusion tensor images
                   recorded on a 3D voxel grid. The SVCM unifies the
                   three-step cascade of standard data processing
                   (voxelwise regression, smoothing, interpolation) into
                   one framework based on B-spline basis functions.
                   Thereby strength is borrowed from spatially correlated
                   voxels to gain a regularization effect right at the
                   estimation stage. Two SVCM variants are conceptualized:
                   a full tensor product approach and a sequential
                   approximation, rendering the SVCM numerically and
                   computationally feasible even for the huge dimension of
                   the joint model in a realistic setup. A simulation
                   study shows that both approaches outperform the
                   standard method of voxelwise regression with subsequent
                   regularization. Application of the fast sequential
                   method to real DTI data demonstrates the inherent
                   ability to increase the grid resolution by evaluating
                   the incorporated basis functions at intermediate
                   points. The resulting continuous regularized tensor
                   field may serve as basis for multiple applications,
                   yet, ameloriation of local adaptivity is desirable. },

                   methods in terms of probability of connection between
                   points and/or regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
                   commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit
                   the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal
                   direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel.
                   Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte
                   Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty
                   generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty
                   is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion
                   orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in
                   terms of the underlying microstructure. RESULTS: Two
                   candidates for describing the uncertainty in the
                   diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability
                   of connection to chosen start points or regions are
                   generated in a number of major tracts. CONCLUSION: The
                   methods presented provide a generic framework for
                   utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic
                   maps of connectivity.},

                   segmentation based on the multi-channel fusion of
                   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The method is
                   motivated by the evidence that independent tissue
                   segmentation based on DTI parametric images provides
                   complementary information of tissue contrast to the
                   tissue segmentation based on structural MRI data. This
                   has important applications in defining accurate tissue
                   maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data.
                   In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation
                   based on DTI data provides an alternative means to
                   obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the
                   tissue segmentation based on DTI data is to classify
                   the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue
                   contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically,
                   because the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values
                   in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are more than twice
                   that of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), we use
                   ADC images to distinguish CSF and non-CSF tissues.
                   Additionally, fractional anisotropy (FA) images are
                   used to separate WM from non-WM tissues, as highly
                   directional white matter structures have much larger
                   fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels
                   to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of
                   the tensor, relative anisotropy (RA), and volume ratio
                   (VR). We developed an approach based on the
                   Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation
                   (STAPLE) algorithm that combines these two-class maps
                   to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of CSF,
                   GM, and WM. Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the
                   performance of our approach. Experimental results of
                   applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and
                   deformable registration of DTI data and spoiled
                   gradient-echo (SPGR) data are also provided.},

                   for characterizing microstructural changes or
                   differences with neuropathology and treatment. The
                   diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the
                   magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the
                   orientation of directional diffusion. This review
                   addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and
                   analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between
                   DTI measures and white matter pathologic features
                   (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage,
                   inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications
                   of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic
                   applications are reviewed. The interpretations of
                   common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional
                   anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, $D_r$; and axial
                   diffusivity, $D_a$) are discussed. In particular, FA is
                   highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not
                   very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or
                   axial). To maximize the specificity and better
                   characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies
                   should use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD
                   and FA, or $D_a$ and $D_r$).},

                   defined in the past only at its core regions (deep
                   white matter). However, the most peripheral white
                   matter areas, which are interleaved between the cortex
                   and the deep white matter, have lacked clear anatomical

                   obtained by embedding fiber tracts into a perceptually

                   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The full diffusion tensor over
                   the entire brain was measured. To optimize the choice
                   of a scalar anisotropy metric, the performances of
                   scalar indices in simulated models and in a healthy

                   quantified by using fractional anisotropy because it
                   provided the best performance in terms of
                   contrast-to-noise ratio as a function of
                   signal-to-noise ratio in simulations. The anisotropy of
                   ischemic white matter decreased (P = .01). Changes in
                   anisotropy in ischemic gray matter were not significant
                   (P = .63). The trace ADC decreased for ischemic gray
                   matter and white matter (P < .001). The first and
                   second eigenvalues decreased in both ischemic gray and
                   ischemic white matter (P < .001). The third eigenvalue
                   decreased in ischemic gray (P = .001) and white matter
                   (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Gray matter is mildly
                   anisotropic in normal and early ischemic states.
                   However, early white matter ischemia is associated with
                   not only changes in trace ADC values but also
                   significant changes in the anisotropy, or shape, of the
                   water self-diffusion tensor.},

  abstract       = {Diffusion-weighted imaging can potentially be used to
                   infer the connectivity of the human brain in vivo using
                   fibre-tracking techniques, and is therefore of great
                   interest to neuroscientists and clinicians. A key
                   requirement for fibre tracking is the accurate
                   estimation of white matter fibre orientations within
                   each imaging voxel. The diffusion tensor model, which
                   is widely used for this purpose, has been shown to be
                   inadequate in crossing fibre regions. A number of
                   approaches have recently been proposed to address this
                   issue, based on high angular resolution
                   diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data. In this study,
                   an experimental model of crossing fibres, consisting of
                   water-filled plastic capillaries, is used to thoroughly
                   assess three such techniques: constrained spherical
                   deconvolution (CSD), super-resolved CSD (super-CSD) and
                   Q-ball imaging (QBI). HARDI data were acquired over a
                   range of crossing angles and b-values, from which fibre
                   orientations were computed using each technique. All
                   techniques were capable of resolving the two fibre
                   populations down to a crossing angle of 45 degrees ,
                   and down to 30 degrees for super-CSD. A bias was
                   observed in the fibre orientations estimated by QBI for
                   crossing angles other than 90 degrees, consistent with
                   previous simulation results. Finally, for a 45 degrees
                   crossing, the minimum b-value required to resolve the
                   fibre orientations was 4000 s/mm(2) for QBI, 2000
                   s/mm(2) for CSD, and 1000 s/mm(2) for super-CSD. The
                   quality of estimation of fibre orientations may
                   profoundly affect fibre tracking attempts, and the
                   results presented provide important additional
                   information regarding performance characteristics of
                   well-known methods.},

                   with fiber tractography (DFT) is the only non-invasive
                   method for measuring white matter pathways in the
                   living human brain. DFT is often used to discover new
                   pathways. But there are also many applications,
                   particularly in visual neuroscience, in which we are
                   confident that two brain regions are connected, and we
                   wish to find the most likely pathway forming the
                   connection. In several cases, current DFT algorithms
                   fail to find these candidate pathways. To overcome this
                   limitation, we have developed a probabilistic DFT
                   algorithm (ConTrack) that identifies the most likely
                   pathways between two regions. We introduce the
                   algorithm in three parts: a sampler to generate a large
                   set of potential pathways, a scoring algorithm that
                   measures the likelihood of a pathway, and an
                   inferential step to identify the most likely pathways
                   connecting two regions. In a series of experiments
                   using human data, we show that ConTrack estimates known
                   pathways at positions that are consistent with those
                   found using a high quality deterministic algorithm.
                   Further we show that separating sampling and scoring
                   enables ConTrack to identify valid pathways, known to
                   exist, that are missed by other deterministic and
                   probabilistic DFT algorithms.},

                   its accuracy has not been formally evaluated. In this

                   (WGA-HRP) with those obtained using in-vivo diffusion

                   the tracer at multiple sites in the brain of a macaque
                   monkey; second, we reconstructed the histological
                   sections of the labeled fiber tracts in 3D; third, we
                   segmented and registered the fibers (somatosensory and
                   motor tracts) with the anatomical in-vivo MRI from the
                   same animal; and last, we conducted fiber tracing along

                   diffusion tracing technique with the injection sites as
                   seeds. To evaluate the performance of DTI fiber
                   tracing, we compared the fibers derived from the DTI
                   tractography with those segmented from the histology.
                   We also studied the influence of the parameters

                   superimposition coefficients between histology and DTI
                   segmentations. While there was generally good visual
                   agreement between the two methods, our quantitative
                   comparisons reveal certain limitations of DTI
                   tractography, particularly for regions at remote
                   locations from seeds. We have thus demonstrated the

                   in a clinical environment, data have to be acquired
                   rapidly, often at the detriment of the image quality.
                   We propose a new variational framework that
                   specifically targets low quality DT-MRI. The Rician
                   nature of the noise on the images leads us to a maximum
                   likelihood strategy to estimate the tensor field. To
                   further reduce the noise, we optimally exploit the
                   spatial correlation by adding to the estimation an
                   anisotropic regularization term. This criterion is
                   easily optimized thanks to the use of the recently
                   introduced Log-Euclidean metrics. Results on real

                   diffusion tensor (DT) images without the need to obtain
                   auxiliary scans for the sole purpose of correction.
                   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DT images are susceptible to
                   distortions caused by eddy currents induced by large
                   diffusion gradients. We propose a new postacquisition
                   correction algorithm that does not require any
                   auxiliary reference scans. It also avoids the
                   problematic procedure of cross-correlating images with
                   significantly different contrasts. A linear model is
                   used to describe the dependence of distortion
                   parameters (translation, scaling, and shear) on the
                   diffusion gradients. The model is solved numerically to
                   provide an individual correction for every
                   diffusion-weighted (DW) image. RESULTS: The assumptions
                   of the linear model were successfully verified in a
                   series of experiments on a silicon oil phantom. The
                   correction obtained for this phantom was compared with
                   correction obtained by a previously published method.
                   The algorithm was then shown to markedly reduce
                   eddy-current distortions in DT images from human
                   subjects. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm can
                   accurately correct eddy-current artifacts in DT images.
                   Its principal advantages are that only images with
                   comparable signals and contrasts are cross-correlated,
                   and no additional scans are required.},

                   effective way to report anatomic locations of interest
                   and to perform anatomic quantification. However,
                   existing stereotaxic atlases lack comprehensive
                   coordinate information about white matter structures.
                   In this paper, white matter-specific atlases in
                   stereotaxic coordinates are introduced. As a reference
                   template, the widely used ICBM-152 was used. The atlas
                   contains fiber orientation maps and hand-segmented
                   white matter parcellation maps based on diffusion
                   tensor imaging (DTI). Registration accuracy by linear
                   and non-linear transformation was measured, and
                   automated template-based white matter parcellation was
                   tested. The results showed a high correlation between
                   the manual ROI-based and the automated approaches for
                   normal adult populations. The atlases are freely
                   available and believed to be a useful resource as a
                   target template and for automated parcellation methods.

                   tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed
                   information about multidirectional fiber architecture
                   within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber
                   tractography results in locations where fiber bundles
                   cross each other. This may lead to the inability to
                   visualize clinically important tracts such as the
                   lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this
                   report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended
                   Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which
                   successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers.
                   We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human
                   brain data, comparing the results with the traditional
                   single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography
                   technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and
                   correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both
                   healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we
                   demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline
                   tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles
                   consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by
                   conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared
                   to the dense connectivity maps generated by
                   probabilistic tractography, the method is
                   computationally efficient and generates discrete
                   geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and
                   clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter
                   pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of
                   functionally relevant white matter areas.},

  abstract       = {This paper describes a new {NMR} imaging modality-{MR}
                   diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an
                   effective diffusion tensor, $D_{\textrm{eff}}$, within
                   a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived
                   from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic
                   diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic
                   tissues, measured noninvasively by these {NMR} methods,
                   is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and
                   mean particle displacements. Once $D_{\textrm{eff}}$ is
                   estimated from a series of {NMR} pulsed-gradient,
                   spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic
                   axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigen-
                   vectors of $D_{\textrm{eff}}$, while the effective
                   diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are
                   the eigenvalues of $D_{\textrm{eff}}$. Diffusion
                   ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from
                   $D_{\textrm{eff}}$, depict both these orthotropic axes
                   and the mean diffusion distances in these directions.
                   Moreover, the three scalar invariants of
                   $D_{\textrm{eff}}$, which are independent of the
                   tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of
                   reference, reveal useful information about molecular
                   mobility reflective of local microstructure and
                   anatomy. Inherently, tensors (like $D_{\textrm{eff}}$)
                   describing transport processes in anisotropic media
                   contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that
                   scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton
                   density, $T_1$, and $T_2$) do not.},

                   analysis of diffusion MRI data in an anatomical
                   tract-based coordinate system. We present a method for
                   automatic generation of white matter tract arc length
                   parameterizations, based on learning a fiber bundle
                   model from tractography from multiple subjects. Our
                   tract-based coordinate system enables TBM for the
                   detection of white matter differences in groups of
                   subjects. We present example TBM results from a study
                   of interhemispheric differences in FA.},

                   dataset is proposed. This fascicle map is defined as a
                   trade-off between local information on voxel
                   microstructure provided by diffusion data and a priori
                   information on the low curvature of plausible
                   fascicles. The optimal fascicle map is the minimum
                   energy configuration of a simulated spin glass in which
                   each spin represents a fascicle piece. This spin glass
                   is embedded into a simulated magnetic external field
                   that tends to align the spins along the more probable
                   fiber orientations according to diffusion models. A
                   model of spin interactions related to the curvature of
                   the underlying fascicles introduces a low bending
                   potential constraint. Hence, the optimal configuration
                   is a trade-off between these two kind of forces acting
                   on the spins. Experimental results are presented for

                   chain method recently introduced to diffusion tensor
                   imaging (DTI) analysis, allowing the probability
                   density function of up to 2 intra-voxel fiber
                   orientations to be inferred. The multiple fiber
                   architecture within a voxel is then assessed by
                   calculating the relative probabilities of a 1 and 2
                   fiber model. It is demonstrated that for realistic

                   characterize the directions of 2 intersecting fibers

                   communicate with each other via axons for the formation
                   of complex neural networks. The structural mapping of
                   such networks during health and disease states is
                   essential for understanding brain function. However,
                   our understanding of brain structural connectivity is
                   surprisingly limited, due in part to the lack of
                   noninvasive methodologies to study axonal anatomy.
                   Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recently developed
                   MRI technique that can measure macroscopic axonal
                   organization in nervous system tissues. In this
                   article, the principles of DTI methodologies are
                   explained, and several applications introduced,
                   including visualization of axonal tracts in myelin and
                   axonal injuries as well as human brain and mouse
                   embryonic development. The strengths and limitations of
                   DTI and key areas for future research and development

                   describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on
                   the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF)
                   estimated from high angular resolution diffusion
                   imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform
                   accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a
                   fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use
                   a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening
                   deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF
                   reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT
                   provides new insight into the relationship between the
                   HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We
                   demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical
                   spherical deconvolution and improves the angular
                   resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of
                   this paper is the development of new deterministic and
                   new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the
                   full multidirectional information obtained through use
                   of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is
                   performed on human brain datasets comparing our new
                   deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in
                   complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an
                   application of our new probabilistic tracking, we
                   quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres
                   intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior
                   longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects.
                   Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based
                   methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to
                   incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

                   borders and cytoarchitecture cannot be visualized in a
                   living brain used for functional studies. Here, we used
                   diffusion-weighted and functional MRI to test
                   structure-function relations directly. Distinct
                   neocortical regions were defined as volumes having
                   similar connectivity profiles and borders identified
                   where connectivity changed. Without using prior
                   information, we found an abrupt profile change where
                   the border between supplementary motor area (SMA) and
                   pre-SMA is expected. Consistent with this anatomical
                   assignment, putative SMA and pre-SMA connected to motor
                   and prefrontal regions, respectively. Excellent spatial
                   correlations were found between volumes defined by
                   using connectivity alone and volumes activated during
                   tasks designed to involve SMA or pre-SMA selectively.
                   This finding demonstrates a strong relationship between
                   structure and function in medial frontal cortex and
                   offers a strategy for testing such correspondences

                   analysis of known bundles of fiber tracts in the human
                   brain is desired. To include the anatomical knowledge
                   in the clustering, we invoke an atlas of fiber tracts,
                   labeled by the number of bundles of interest. In this
                   work, we construct such an atlas and use it to cluster
                   all fiber tracts in the white matter. To build the
                   atlas, we start with a set of labeled ROIs specified by
                   an expert and extract the fiber tracts initiating from
                   each ROI. Affine registration is used to project the
                   extracted fiber tracts of each subject to the atlas,
                   whereas their B-spline representation is used to
                   efficiently compare them to the fiber tracts in the
                   atlas and assign cluster labels. Expert visual
                   inspection of the result confirms that the proposed
                   method is very promising and efficient in clustering of

                   the optimal value of the diffusion weighting factor b
                   for estimating white-matter fiber orientations using
                   diffusion MRI with a standard spherical sampling
                   scheme. We devise an algorithm for determining the
                   optimal echo time, pulse width, and pulse separation in
                   the pulsed-gradient spinecho sequence for a specific
                   value of b. The Monte Carlo simulations provide an
                   estimate of the optimal value of b for recovering one
                   and two fiber orientations. We show that the optimum is
                   largely independent of the noise level in the
                   measurements and the number of gradient directions and
                   that the optimum depends only weakly on the diffusion
                   anisotropy, the maximum gradient strength, and the spin
                   – spin relaxation time. The optimum depends strongly on
                   the mean diffusivity. In brain tissue, the optima we
                   estimate are in the ranges [0.7, 1.0] \times 10^9 s
                   m^{-2} and [2.2, 2.8] \times 10^9 s m^{-2} for the one-
                   and two-fiber cases, respectively. The best b for
                   estimating the fractional anisotropy is slightly higher
                   than for estimating fiber directions in the one-fiber
                   case and slightly lower in the two-fiber case. To
                   estimate Tr(D) in the onefiber case, the optimal
                   setting is higher still. Simulations suggest that a
                   ratio of high to low b measurements of 5 to 1 is a good
                   compromise for measuring fiber directions and size and

                   diffusion MR signals and the underlying diffusion
                   displacement, a new relation is derived to estimate the
                   spin distribution function (SDF) directly from
                   diffusion MR signals. This relation leads to an imaging
                   method called generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI),
                   which can obtain the SDF from the shell sampling scheme
                   used in q-ball imaging (QBI) or the grid sampling
                   scheme used in diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). The
                   accuracy of GQI was evaluated by a simulation study and
                   an in vivo experiment in comparison with QBI and DSI.
                   The simulation results showed that the accuracy of GQI
                   was comparable to that of QBI and DSI. The simulation
                   study of GQI also showed that an anisotropy index,
                   named quantitative anisotropy, was correlated with the
                   volume fraction of the resolved fiber component. The in
                   vivo images of GQI demonstrated that SDF patterns were
                   similar to the ODFs reconstructed by QBI or DSI. The
                   tractography generated from GQI was also similar to
                   those generated from QBI and DSI. In conclusion, the

                   sampling schemes and can provide directional and
                   quantitative information about the crossing fibers.},

  abstract       = {PURPOSE: To propose a new method to optimize the
                   ordering of gradient directions in diffusion-weighted
                   MRI so that partial scans have the best spherical
                   coverage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI
                   often uses a spherical sampling scheme, which acquires
                   images sequentially with diffusion-weighting gradients
                   in unique directions distributed isotropically on the
                   hemisphere. If not all of the measurements can be
                   completed, the quality of diffusion tensors fitted to
                   the partial scan is sensitive to the order of the
                   gradient directions in the scanner protocol. If the
                   directions are in a random order, then a partial scan
                   may cover some parts of the hemisphere densely but
                   other parts sparsely and thus provide poor spherical
                   coverage. We compare the results of ordering with
                   previously published methods for optimizing the
                   acquisition in simulation. RESULTS: Results show that
                   all methods produce similar results and all improve the
                   accuracy of the estimated diffusion tensors
                   significantly over unordered acquisitions. CONCLUSION:
                   The new ordering method improves the spherical coverage
                   of partial scans and has the advantage of maintaining
                   the optimal coverage of the complete scan.},

                   tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle
                   segmentations, we generate an arc length
                   parameterization of the bundle with point
                   correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
                   allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this
                   paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber
                   coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce
                   an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial
                   distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject
                   variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for
                   generating arc length correspondences across
                   hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric
                   diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF)
                   and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study
                   demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may
                   not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in
                   entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD)
                   differences found in AF. We report TBM results of
                   higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left
                   hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3),
                   the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the
                   left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related
                   to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the
                   diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the
                   significance levels onto the tractography trajectories
                   for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical
                   locations of the interhemispheric differences. The TBM
                   approach brings analysis of DTI data into the

                   with its detailed validation and a discussion on its
                   benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical
                   solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular
                   resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical
                   harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term
                   based on the Laplace– Beltrami operator defined on the
                   unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical
                   simplification of the Funk–Radon transform which
                   approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the
                   Funk–Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then,
                   we show that the Laplace–Beltrami regularization is
                   theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov
                   regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing
                   angular resolution, the Laplace–Beltrami regularization
                   reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber
                   detection while reducing angular error in the ODF
                   maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative
                   validation is performed against ground truth from
                   synthetic data and against real data from a biological
                   phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our

                   in the human brain and provides the practical advantage

                   than does the standard {DTI} method. The effectiveness
                   of the new fiber tracking algorithm was demonstrated
                   via analyses on real and synthetic {DWI} datasets. In
                   addition, the general analytic expression of high order
                   b matrix is derived in the case of twice refocused
                   spin-echo ({TRSE}) pulse sequence which is used in the
                   {DWI} data acquisition. Based on our results, we
                   discuss the benefits of {GDT} and the second order
                   diffusion tensor on fiber tracking.},

                   can create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR
                   images. These images, acquired by measuring the
                   attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally
                   dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be
                   useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke
                   and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents
                   an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence
                   that displays less distortion and consequently improves
                   image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse
                   provides better image quality with less distortion at
                   no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and
                   allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By
                   adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy
                   currents with a single exponential decay constant can
                   be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay
                   constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is
                   demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion
                   anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

  abstract       = {We describe a method for automatically building
                   statistical shape models from a training set of example
                   boundaries/surfaces. These models show considerable
                   promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting
                   images. One of the drawbacks of the approach is,
                   however, the need to establish a set of dense
                   correspondences between all members of a set of
                   training shapes. Often this is achieved by locating a
                   set of "landmarks" manually on each training image,
                   which is time consuming and subjective in two
                   dimensions and almost impossible in three dimensions.
                   We describe how shape models can be built automatically
                   by posing the correspondence problem as one of finding
                   the parameterization for each shape in the training
                   set. We select the set of parameterizations that build
                   the "best" model. We define "best" as that which
                   minimizes the description length of the training set,
                   arguing that this leads to models with good
                   compactness, specificity and generalization ability. We
                   show how a set of shape parameterizations can be
                   represented and manipulated in order to build a minimum
                   description length model. Results are given for several
                   different training sets of two-dimensional boundaries,
                   showing that the proposed method constructs better
                   models than other approaches including manual
                   landmarking-the current gold standard. We also show
                   that the method can be extended straightforwardly to
                   three dimensions.},

                   the noise sensitivity of measurement by magnetic
                   resonance imaging (MRI) of the diffusion tensor (D) of
                   water and the number N of diffusion-weighting (DW)
                   gradient directions, using computer simulations of
                   strongly anisotropic fibers with variable orientation.
                   The DW directions uniformly sampled the diffusion
                   ellipsoid surface. It is shown that the variation of
                   the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of three ideally
                   rotationally invariant scalars of D due to variable
                   fiber orientation provides an objective quantitative
                   measure for the diffusion ellipsoid sampling
                   efficiency, which is independent of the SNR value of
                   the baseline signal obtained without DW; the SNR
                   variation decreased asymptotically with increasing N.
                   The minimum number N(0) of DW directions, which
                   minimized the SNR variation of the three scalars of D

                   noise and can improve the repeatability/reliability of

                   measurement in the presence of magnetic field

                   range of single and multiple fibre configurations. This

                   generated that are parametrized according to the

                   a powerful method to extract the anatomical

                   the currently available methods of fibre tracking is
                   the reconstruction of long neuronal pathways in small
                   successive steps by following the local, voxel-defined
                   fibre direction. Starting from local information on the
                   diffusivity, long-distance connections are determined.
                   This method is inherently prone to instability, since a
                   mistake at a single crossing affects radically the
                   final result. In this paper we present a method based
                   on a new principle. Instead of walking successively
                   through the volume all neuronal pathways and the
                   totality of the signal is taken into account at the
                   same time. This novel approach is capable to
                   reconstruct crossing and spreading fibre configuration.},

                   nerve, white matter in spinal cord, or white matter in
                   brain forms the basis for the utilization of diffusion
                   tensor imaging (DTI) to track fibre pathways. The fact
                   that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying
                   tissue microstructure provides a unique method of
                   assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural
                   fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of
                   neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is
                   to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic
                   resonance measurements of water diffusion and its
                   anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the
                   underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The
                   emphasis of the review will be on model neurological
                   systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic
                   discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and
                   their evaluation will be presented followed by an
                   overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and
                   compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy.
                   Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies

                   registration of white matter tractographies extracted
                   from diffusion tensor-magnetic resonance imaging scans.
                   The fibers are projected into a high dimensional
                   feature space based on the sequence of their 3-D
                   coordinates. Adaptive mean-shift clustering is applied
                   to extract a compact set of representative fiber-modes
                   (FM). Each FM is assigned to a multivariate Gaussian
                   distribution according to its population thereby
                   leading to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
                   representation for the entire set of fibers. The
                   registration between two fiber sets is treated as the
                   alignment of two GMMs and is performed by maximizing
                   their correlation ratio. A nine-parameters affine
                   transform is recovered and eventually refined to a
                   twelve-parameters affine transform using an innovative
                   mean-shift based registration refinement scheme
                   presented in this paper. The validation of the
                   algorithm on synthetic intrasubject data demonstrates
                   its robustness to interrupted and deviating fiber
                   artifacts as well as outliers. Using real intrasubject
                   data, a comparison is conducted to other intensity
                   based and fiber-based registration algorithms,
                   demonstrating competitive results. An option for
                   tracking-in-time, on specific white matter fiber
                   tracts, is also demonstrated on the real data.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, a hybrid discriminative/generative
                   model for brain anatomical structure segmentation is
                   proposed. The learning aspect of the approach is
                   emphasized. In the discriminative appearance models,
                   various cues such as intensity and curvatures are
                   combined to locally capture the complex appearances of
                   different anatomical structures. A probabilistic
                   boosting tree (PBT) framework is adopted to learn
                   multi-class discriminative models that combine hundreds
                   of features across different scales. On the generative
                   side, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shape models
                   are used to capture the global shape information about
                   each anatomical structure. The parameters to combine
                   the discriminative appearance and generative shape
                   models are also automatically learned. Thus low-level
                   and highlevel information is learned and integrated in
                   a hybrid model. Segmentations are obtained by
                   minimizing an energy function associated with the
                   proposed hybrid model. Finally, a gridface structure is
                   designed to explicitly represent the 3D region
                   topology. This representation handles an arbitrary
                   number of regions and facilitates fast surface
                   evolution. Our system was trained and tested on a set
                   of 3D MRI volumes and the results obtained are
                   encouraging.},

                   mostly examined by functional magnetic resonance
                   imaging (fMRI). However, the cause of the detected
                   activity relies on the anatomy. Diffusion tensor
                   magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) as a noninvasive
                   modality providing in vivo anatomical information
                   allows determining neural fiber connections which leads
                   to brain mapping. Still a complete map of fiber paths
                   representing the human brain is missing in literature.
                   One of the main drawbacks of reliable fiber mapping is
                   the correct detection of the orientation of multiple
                   fibers within a single imaging voxel. In this study a
                   method based on linear data structures is proposed to
                   define the fiber paths regarding their diffusivity.
                   Another advantage of the proposed method is that the
                   analysis is applied on entire brain diffusion tensor
                   data. The implementation results are promising, so that
                   the method will be developed as a rapid fiber
                   tractography algorithm for the clinical use as future

                   and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the evaluation of
                   diffusion parameters such as apparent diffusion
                   coefficients and anisotropy indices is affected by
                   image distortions that arise from residual eddy
                   currents produced by the diffusion-sensitizing
                   gradients. Correction methods that coregister
                   diffusion-weighted and non-diffusion-weighted images
                   suffer from the different contrast properties inherent
                   in these image types. Here, a postprocessing correction
                   scheme is introduced that makes use of the inverse
                   characteristics of distortions generated by gradients
                   with reversed polarity. In this approach, only
                   diffusion-weighted images with identical contrast are
                   included for correction. That is,
                   non-diffusion-weighted images are not needed as a
                   reference for registration. Furthermore, the
                   acquisition of an additional dataset with moderate
                   diffusion-weighting as suggested by Haselgrove and
                   Moore (Magn Reson Med 1996;36:960-964) is not required.
                   With phantom data it is shown that the theoretically
                   expected symmetry of distortions is preserved in the
                   images to a very high degree, demonstrating the
                   practicality of the new method. Results from human
                   brain images are also presented.},

                   neonates for regional and age-related differences in
                   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
                   anisotropy (FA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight healthy
                   adults and 20 healthy neonates were examined with a
                   3.0-T head-only magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit by
                   using a single-shot diffusion-tensor sequence. Trace
                   ADC maps, FA maps, directional maps of the putative
                   directions of white matter (WM) tracts, and
                   fiber-tracking maps were obtained. Regions of
                   interest-eight in WM and one in gray matter (GM)-were
                   predefined for the ADC and FA measurements. The Student
                   t test was used to compare FA and ADC between adults
                   and neonates, whereas the Tukey multiple-comparison
                   test was used to compare FA and ADC in different brain
                   regions in the adult and neonate groups. RESULTS: A
                   global elevation in ADC (P <.001) in both GM and WM and
                   a reduction in FA (P <.001) in WM were observed in
                   neonates as compared with these values in adults. In
                   addition, significant regional variations in FA and ADC
                   were observed in both groups. Regional variations in FA
                   and ADC were less remarkable in adults, whereas
                   neonates had consistently higher FA values and lower
                   ADC values in the central WM as compared with these
                   values in the peripheral WM. Fiber tracking revealed
                   only major WM tracts in the neonates but fibers
                   extending to the peripheral WM in the adults.
                   CONCLUSION: There were regional differences in FA and
                   ADC values in the neonates; such variations were less
                   remarkable in the adults.},

                   previously been used to define large white-matter
                   tracts in the living human brain, but this technique
                   has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray
                   matter. Here we identified specific connections between
                   human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic
                   tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data.
                   Classification of thalamic gray matter based on
                   cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct

                   tensor. Ideally, one wants to take into account both
                   the properties of human color vision and of the given
                   display hardware to produce a representation in which
                   differences in the orientation of anisotropic
                   structures are proportional to the perceived
                   differences in color. It is argued here that such a
                   goal cannot be achieved in general and therefore,
                   empirical or heuristic schemes, which avoid some of the
                   common artifacts of previously proposed approaches, are
                   implemented. Directionally encoded color (DEC) maps of
                   the human brain obtained using these schemes clearly

                   (DWI) as a method for examining neural connectivity,
                   its accuracy has not been formally evaluated. In this
                   study, we directly compared connections that were
                   visualized using injected neural tract tracers
                   (WGA-HRP) with those obtained using in-vivo diffusion
                   tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. First, we injected
                   the tracer at multiple sites in the brain of a macaque
                   monkey; second, we reconstructed the histological
                   sections of the labeled fiber tracts in 3D; third, we
                   segmented and registered the fibers (somatosensory and
                   motor tracts) with the anatomical in-vivo MRI from the
                   same animal; and last, we conducted fiber tracing along
                   the same pathways on the DTI data using a classical
                   diffusion tracing technique with the injection sites as
                   seeds. To evaluate the performance of DTI fiber
                   tracing, we compared the fibers derived from the DTI
                   tractography with those segmented from the histology.
                   We also studied the influence of the parameters
                   controlling the tractography by comparing Dice
                   superimposition coefficients between histology and DTI
                   segmentations. While there was generally good visual
                   agreement between the two methods, our quantitative
                   comparisons reveal certain limitations of DTI
                   tractography, particularly for regions at remote
                   locations from seeds. We have thus demonstrated the
                   importance of appropriate settings for realistic

                   representation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
                   (dMRI) of high angular resolution. This 5-D space is
                   basically a non-Euclidean space of position and
                   orientation in which crossing fiber tracts can be
                   clearly disentangled, that cannot be separated in
                   three-dimensional position space. This new
                   representation provides many possibilities for
                   processing and analysis since classical methods for
                   scalar images can be extended to higher dimensions even
                   if the spaces are not Euclidean. In this paper, we show
                   examples of how regularization and segmentation of dMRI
                   is simplified with this new representation. The
                   regularization is used with the purpose of denoising
                   and but also to facilitate the segmentation task by
                   using several scales, each scale representing a
                   different level of resolution. We implement in five
                   dimensions the Chan-Vese method combined with active
                   contours without edges for the segmentation and the
                   total variation functional for the regularization. The
                   purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of
                   segmenting white matter structures directly as entirely
                   separated bundles in this 5-D space. We will present
                   results from a synthetic model and results on real data
                   of a human brain acquired with diffusion spectrum
                   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one of the dMRI of
                   high angular resolution available. These results will
                   lead us to the conclusion that this new
                   high-dimensional representation indeed simplifies the
                   problem of segmentation and regularization.},

                   characterize the intravoxel anisotropy based on
                   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The proposed
                   solution, under a fully Bayesian formalism, deals with
                   the problem of joint Bayesian Model selection and
                   parameter estimation to reconstruct the principal
                   diffusion profiles or primary fiber orientations in a
                   voxel. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm
                   based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   (RJMCMC) method in order to perform the Bayesian
                   computation. RJMCMC is a good choice for this problem
                   because of its ability to jump between models of
                   different dimensionality. This methodology provides
                   posterior estimates of the parameters of interest
                   (fiber orientation, diffusivities etc) unconditional of
                   the model assumed. It also gives an empirical posterior
                   distribution of the number of primary nerve fiber
                   orientations given the DWI data. Different probability
                   maps can be assessed using this methodology: 1) the
                   intravoxel fiber orientation map (or orientational
                   distribution function) that gives the probability of
                   finding a fiber in a particular spatial orientation; 2)
                   a three-dimensional map of the probability of finding a
                   particular number of fibers in each voxel; 3) a
                   three-dimensional MaxPro (maximum probability) map that
                   provides the most probable number of fibers for each
                   voxel. In order to study the performance and
                   reliability of the presented approach, we tested it on
                   synthetic data; an ex-vivo phantom of intersecting
                   capillaries; and DWI data from a human subject.},

                   Also, damage to portions of these tracts is associated
                   with alexia. To assess the reliability of the DTI-FT

                   converged onto the same positions within the splenium.
                   We further characterized the properties of the
                   estimated occipital-callosal fiber tracts by combining
                   them with functional MRI. We used functional MRI to
                   identify visual field maps in cortex and labeled fibers
                   by the cortical functional response at the fiber
                   endpoint. This labeling reveals a regular organization
                   of the fibers within the splenium. The dorsal visual
                   maps (dorsal V3, V3A, V3B, V7) send projections through
                   a large band in the middle of the splenium, whereas
                   ventral visual maps (ventral V3, V4) send projections
                   through the inferior-anterior corner of the splenium.
                   The agreement between the independent left/right
                   estimates, further supported by previous descriptions
                   of homologous tracts in macaque, validates the DTI-FT
                   methods. However, a principal limitation of these
                   methods is low sensitivity: a large number of fiber
                   tracts that connect homotopic regions of ventral and
                   lateral visual cortex were undetected. We conclude that
                   most of the estimated tracts are real and can be

                   Specifically, we applied this technique to visualize in
                   vivo (i) the superior longitudinal (arcuate)
                   fasciculus, (ii) the inferior longitudinal fasciculus,

                   cingulum, (vii) the anterior commissure, (viii) the
                   corpus callosum, (ix) the internal capsule, and (x) the
                   fornix. These fasciculi were first isolated and were

                   white matter anatomy that have previously been

                   able to interactively delineate and visualize white
                   matter fasciculi over their entire length in vivo, in a

  abstract       = {Lateral premotor cortex (PM) in the macaque monkey can
                   be segregated into structurally and functionally
                   distinct subregions, including a major division between
                   dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) parts, which have
                   distinct cytoarchitecture, function, and patterns of
                   connectivity with both frontal and parietal cortical
                   areas. The borders of their subregions are less well
                   defined in the human brain. Here we use diffusion
                   tractography to identify a reproducible border between
                   dorsal and ventral subregions of human precentral
                   gyrus. We derive connectivity fingerprints for the two
                   subregions and demonstrate that each has a distinctive
                   pattern of connectivity with frontal cortex and lateral
                   parietal cortex, suggesting that these areas correspond
                   to human PMd and PMv. Although putative human PMd has a
                   high probability of connection with the superior
                   parietal lobule, dorsal prefrontal cortex, and
                   cingulate cortex, human PMv has a higher probability of
                   connection with the anterior inferior parietal lobule
                   and ventral prefrontal cortex. Finally, we assess the
                   correspondence between our PMd/PMv border and local
                   sulcal and functional anatomy. The location of the
                   border falls at the level of the gyral branch that
                   divides the inferior precentral sulcus from the
                   superior precentral sulcus and corresponded closely to
                   the location of a functional border defined using
                   previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.},

  abstract       = {Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that
                   allows the measurement of water molecule diffusion
                   through tissue in vivo. The directional features of
                   water diffusion allow one to infer the connectivity
                   patterns prevalent in tissue and possibly track changes
                   in this connectivity over time for various clinical
                   applications. In this paper, we present a novel
                   statistical model for diffusion-weighted MR signal
                   attenuation which postulates that the water molecule
                   diffusion can be characterized by a continuous mixture
                   of diffusion tensors. An interesting observation is
                   that this continuous mixture and the MR signal
                   attenuation are related through the Laplace transform
                   of a probability distribution over symmetric positive
                   definite matrices. We then show that when the mixing
                   distribution is a Wishart distribution, the resulting
                   closed form of the Laplace transform leads to a
                   Rigaut-type asymptotic fractal expression, which has
                   been phenomenologically used in the past to explain the
                   MR signal decay but never with a rigorous mathematical
                   justification until now. Our model not only includes
                   the traditional diffusion tensor model as a special
                   instance in the limiting case, but also can be adjusted
                   to describe complex tissue structure involving multiple
                   fiber populations. Using this new model in conjunction
                   with a spherical deconvolution approach, we present an
                   efficient scheme for estimating the water molecule
                   displacement probability functions on a voxel-by-voxel
                   basis. Experimental results on both simulations and
                   real data are presented to demonstrate the robustness
                   and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.},

                   usage in clinical and basic science research in the
                   past decade. By assessing the water diffusion
                   anisotropy within biological tissues, e.g. brain,
                   researchers can infer different fiber structures
                   important for neural pathways. A typical DTI data set
                   contains at least one base image and six
                   diffusion-weighted images along non-collinear encoding
                   directions. The resultant images can then be combined
                   to derive the three principal axes of the diffusion
                   tensor and their respective cross terms, which can in
                   turn be used to compute fractional anisotropy (FA)
                   maps, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and to
                   construct axonal fibers. The above operations all
                   assume that DTI images along different
                   diffusion-weighting directions for the same brain
                   register to each other without spatial distortions.
                   This assumption is generally false, as the large
                   diffusion-weighting gradients would usually induce eddy
                   currents to generate diffusion-weighting
                   direction-dependent field gradients, leading to
                   mis-registration within the DTI data set. Traditional
                   methods for correcting magnetic field-induced
                   distortions do not usually take into account these
                   direction-dependent eddy currents unique for DTI, and
                   they are usually time-consuming because multiple phase
                   images need to be acquired. In this report, we describe
                   our theory and implementation of an efficient and
                   effective method to correct for the main field and eddy
                   current-induced direction-dependent distortions for DTI
                   images under a unified framework to facilitate the

                   the major imaging modality to study properties of white
                   matter and the geometry of fiber tracts of the human
                   brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on regional
                   statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean
                   diffusivity (MD) derived from tensors. Existing
                   analysis techniques do not sufficiently take into
                   account that the measurements are tensors, and thus
                   require proper interpolation and statistics of tensors,
                   and that regions of interest are fiber tracts with
                   complex spatial geometry. We propose a new framework
                   for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that
                   systematically includes tensor interpolation and
                   averaging, using nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space.
                   A new measure of tensor anisotropy, called geodesic
                   anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA. As a
                   result, tracts of interest are represented by the
                   geometry of the medial spine attributed with tensor
                   statistics (average and variance) calculated within
                   cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is
                   demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data
                   set. A validation study, based on six repeated scans of
                   the same subject, assesses the reproducibility of this
                   new DTI data analysis framework.},
