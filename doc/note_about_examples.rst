=========================
A note about the examples
=========================

The examples here are some uses of the analysis and visualization functionality
of dipy_, with example data from actual neuroscience experiments, or with
synthetic data, which is generated as part of the example.

All the examples presented in the documentation are generated from *fully
functioning* python scripts, which are available as part of the source
distribution in the doc/examples folder.

If you want to replicate a particular analysis or visualization, simply copy
the relevant ".py" script from the source distribution, edit out the body of
the text of the example (which appear as blocks of text between triple quotes
'"""') and alter it to your purpose.

Thanks to the developers of PyMVPA_ for designing the software which enables us
to provide these documented examples!
