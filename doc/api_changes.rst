API changes
============

Here we provide information about functions or classes that have been removed,
renamed or are deprecated (not recommended) during different release circles.

DIPY 0.13 Changes
-----------------

No major API changes.

**Notes**

``dipy.viz.fvtk`` module will be deprecated on release 0.14. Use ``dipy.viz.ui`` instead.
``dipy.io.trackvis`` module will be deprecated on release 0.14. Use ``dipy.io.streamline`` instead.

DIPY 0.12 Changes
-----------------
**Dropped support for Python 2.6***

It has been 6 years since the release of Python 2.7, and multiple other
versions have been released since. As far as we know, DIPY still works well
on Python 2.6, but we no longer test on this version, and we recommend that
users upgrade to Python 2.7 or newer to use DIPY.


**Tracking**

``probabilistic_direction_getter.ProbabilisticDirectionGetter`` input parameters
have changed. Now the optional parameter ``pmf_threshold=0.1`` (previously fixed
to 0.0) removes directions with probability lower than ``pmf_threshold`` from
the probability mass function (pmf) when selecting the tracking direction.

**DKI**

Default of DKI model fitting was changed from "OLS" to "WLS".

The default max_kurtosis of the functions axial_kurtosis, mean_kurtosis,
radial_kurotis was changed from 3 to 10.

**Visualization**

Prefer using the UI elements in ``dipy.viz.ui`` rather than
``dipy.viz.widgets``.

**IO**

Use the module ``nibabel.streamlines`` for saving trk files and not
``nibabel.trackvis``. Requires upgrading to nibabel 2+.

DIPY 0.10 Changes
-----------------

** New visualization module**

``fvtk.slicer`` input parameters have changed. Now the slicer function is
more powerfull and supports RGB images too. See tutorial ``viz_slice.py`` for
more information.

**Interpolation**
The default behavior of the function `core.sphere.interp_rbf` has changed.
The default smoothing parameter is now set to 0.1 (previously 0). In addition,
the default norm is now `angle` (was previously `euclidean_norm`). Note that
the use of `euclidean_norm` is discouraged, and this norm will be deprecated
in the 0.11 release cycle.

**Registration**

The following utilty functions from ``vector_fields`` module were renamed:

``warp_2d_affine`` is now ``transform_2d_affine``
``warp_2d_affine_nn`` is now ``transform_2d_affine_nn``
``warp_3d_affine`` is now ``transform_3d_affine``
``warp_3d_affine_nn`` is now ``transform_3d_affine_nn``


DIPY 0.9 Changes
----------------

**GQI integration length**

Calculation of integration length in GQI2 now matches the calculation in the
'standard' method. Using values of 1-1.3 for either is recommended (see
docs and references therein).


DIPY 0.8 Changes
----------------

**Peaks**

The module ``peaks`` is now available from ``dipy.direction`` and it can still
be accessed from ``dipy.reconst`` but it will be completelly removed in version
0.10.

**Resample**

The function ``resample`` from ``dipy.align.aniso2iso`` is deprecated. Please,
use instead ``reslice`` from ``dipy.align.reslice``. The module ``aniso2iso``
will be completely removed in version 0.10.


Changes between 0.7.1 and 0.6
------------------------------

**Peaks_from_model**

The function ``peaks_from_model`` is now available from ``dipy.reconst.peaks``
. Please replace all imports like::

    from dipy.reconst.odf import peaks_from_model

with::

    from dipy.reconst.peaks import peaks_from_model

**Target**

The function ``target`` from ``dipy.tracking.utils`` now takes an affine
transform instead of a voxel sizes array. Please update all code using
``target`` in a way similar to this::

    img = nib.load(anat)
    voxel_dim = img.header['pixdim'][1:4]
    streamlines = utils.target(streamlines, img.get_data(), voxel_dim)

to something similar to::

    img = nib.load(anat)
    streamlines = utils.target(streamlines, img.get_data(), img.affine)
