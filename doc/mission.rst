The purpose of DIPY_ is to make it **easier to do better diffusion MR imaging research**. Following up with the nipy mission statement we aim to build software that is

    * **clearly written**
    * **clearly explained**
    * **a good fit for the underlying ideas**
    * **a natural home for collaboration**

We hope that, if we fail to do this, you will let us know and we will try and make it better.
