Diffusion Imaging In Python - Documentation
===========================================

.. container:: index-paragraph

   DIPY_ is the paragon 3D/4D+ imaging library in Python. Contains generic methods for
   spatial normalization, signal processing, machine learning, statistical analysis
   and visualization of medical images. Additionally, it contains
   specialized methods for computational anatomy including diffusion,
   perfusion and structural imaging.

   DIPY is part of the `NiPy ecosystem <https://nipy.org/>`__.
