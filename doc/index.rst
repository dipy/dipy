Getting Started
***************

Here is a simple example showing how to calculate `color FA`. We
use a single Tensor model to reconstruct the datasets which are saved in a
Nifti file along with the b-values and b-vectors which are saved as text files.
In this example we use only a few voxels with 101 gradient directions::

    from dipy.data import get_data
    fimg, fbval, fbvec = get_data('small_101D')

    import nibabel as nib
    img = nib.load(fimg)
    data = img.get_data()

    from dipy.io import read_bvals_bvecs
    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)

    from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel
    ten = TensorModel(gtab)
    tenfit = ten.fit(data)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import fractional_anisotropy
    fa = fractional_anisotropy(tenfit.evals)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import color_fa
    cfa = color_fa(fa, tenfit.evecs)

As an exercise try to calculate the `color FA` with your datasets. Here is how
a slice should look like.
