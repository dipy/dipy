Dipy
####

Dipy_ is an *international*, **free** and **open soure** software project for
**diffusion** *magnetic resonance imaging* **analysis**.

Depends on a few standard libraries: python_ (the core language), numpy_ (for
numerical computation), scipy_ (for more specific mathematical operations),
cython_ (for extra speed) and nibabel_ (for file formats). Optionally, it can
use python-vtk_ (for visualisation), pytables_ (for handling large datasets),
matplotlib_ (for scientific plotting), and ipython_ (for interaction with the
code and its results).

Dipy is multiplatform and will run under any standard operating systems such as
*Windows*, *Linux*, *Mac OS X*.

Just some of our **state-of-the-art** applications are:

- Reconstruction algorithms e.g. GQI, DTI  
- Tractography generation algorithms e.g. EuDX
- Intelligent downsampling of tracks
- Ultra fast tractography clustering
- Resampling datasets with anisotropic voxels to isotropic
- Visualizing multiple brains simultaneously
- Finding track correspondence between different brains
- Warping tractographies into another space e.g. MNI space
- Reading many different file formats e.g. Trackvis or Nifti
- Dealing with huge tractographies without memory restrictions
- Playing with datasets interactively without storing
- And much more and even more to come in next releases

An Example
~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a tiny usage example for dipy::

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from dipy.reconst.dti import Tensor
  >>> from dipy.data import get_data
  >>> fimg,fbval,fbvec=get_data('small_101D')
  >>> import nibabel as nib
  >>> img=nib.load(fimg)
  >>> data=img.get_data()
  >>> bvals=np.loadtxt(fbvals)
  >>> gradients=np.loadtxt(fbvecs).T
  >>> ten=Tensor(data,bvals,gradients,thresh=50)
  >>> FA=ten.fa()
  >>> MASK = FA < 0.2

In this code snippet we loaded a small diffusion dataset with their data,
b-vectors and b-values, calculated the Tensors and fractional anisotropy (FA)
and then created a mask to remove the regions with low anisotropy.

A skeleton

   **This is a depiction of a tractography skeleton created using dipy**. 

   Using skeletal tracks we can very easily have a fast visual description of our
   datasets. If you want to learn more how you can create these with your datasets 
   read the examples in our :ref:`documentation` .
