Diffusion Imaging In Python
###########################

DIPY_ is the paragon 3D/4D+ imaging library in Python. Contains generic methods for
spatial normalization, signal processing, machine learning, statistical analysis
and visualization of medical images. Additionally, it contains
specialized methods for computational anatomy including diffusion,
perfusion and structural imaging.

Getting Started
***************

Here is a quick snippet showing how to calculate `color FA` also known as the
DEC map. We use a Tensor model to reconstruct the datasets which are
saved in a Nifti file along with the b-values and b-vectors which are saved as
text files. Finally, we save our result as a Nifti file ::

    fdwi = 'dwi.nii.gz'
    fbval = 'dwi.bval'
    fbvec = 'dwi.bvec'

    from dipy.io.image import load_nifti, save_nifti
    from dipy.io import read_bvals_bvecs
    from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
    from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel

    data, affine = load_nifti(fdwi)
    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)

    tenmodel = TensorModel(gtab)
    tenfit = tenmodel.fit(data)

    save_nifti('colorfa.nii.gz', tenfit.color_fa, affine)

As an exercise, you can try to calculate `color FA` with your datasets. You will need
to replace the filepaths `fdwi`, `fbval` and `fbvec`. Here is what
a slice should look like.
