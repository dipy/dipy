Diffusion Imaging In Python
###########################

Dipy_ is a **free** and **open source** software project for computational neuroanatomy,
focusing mainly on **diffusion** *magnetic resonance imaging* (dMRI) analysis. It implements a
broad range of algorithms for denoising, registration, reconstruction, tracking, clustering,
visualization, and statistical analysis of MRI data.

**********
Highlights
**********

**Dipy 0.11.0** is now available. New features include:

- New framework for contextual enhancement of ODFs.
- Compatibility with numpy (1.11).
- Compatibility with VTK 7.0 which supports Python 3.x.
- Faster PIESNO for noise estimation.
- Reorient gradient directions according to motion correction parameters.
- Supporting Python 3.3+ but not 3.2.
- Reduced memory usage in DTI.
- DSI now can use datasets with multiple b0s.
- Fixed different issues with Windows 64bit and Python 3.5.

**Dipy 0.10.1** is now available. New features in this release include:

- Compatibility with new versions of scipy (0.16) and numpy (1.10).
- New cleaner visualization API, including compatibility with VTK 6, and functions to create your own interactive visualizations.
- Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI): Google Summer of Code work by Rafael Henriques.
- Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP) MRI for tissue microstructure estimation.
- Anisotropic Power Maps from spherical harmonic coefficients.
- A new framework for affine registration of images.

Getting Started
***************

Here is a simple example showing how to calculate `color FA`. We
use a single Tensor model to reconstruct the datasets which are saved in a
Nifti file along with the b-values and b-vectors which are saved as text files.
In this example we use only a few voxels with 101 gradient directions::

    from dipy.data import get_data
    fimg, fbval, fbvec = get_data('small_101D')

    import nibabel as nib
    img = nib.load(fimg)
    data = img.get_data()

    from dipy.io import read_bvals_bvecs
    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)

    from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel
    ten = TensorModel(gtab)
    tenfit = ten.fit(data)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import fractional_anisotropy
    fa = fractional_anisotropy(tenfit.evals)

    from dipy.reconst.dti import color_fa
    cfa = color_fa(fa, tenfit.evecs)

As an exercise try to calculate the `color FA` with your datasets. Here is what
a slice should look like.
