Diffusion Imaging In Python
###########################

DIPY_ is a **free** and **open source** software project for computational neuroanatomy,
focusing mainly on **diffusion** *magnetic resonance imaging* (dMRI) analysis. It implements a
broad range of algorithms for denoising, registration, reconstruction, tracking, clustering,
visualization, and statistical analysis of MRI data.

Highlights
**********

**DIPY 0.14.0** is now available. New features include:

- RecoBundles: anatomically relevant segmentation of bundles
- New super fast clustering algorithm: QuickBundlesX
- New tracking algorithm: Particle Filtering Tracking.
- New tracking algorithm: Probabilistic Residual Bootstrap Tracking.
- Integration of the Streamlines API for reading, saving and processing tractograms.
- Fiber ORientation Estimated using Continuous Axially Symmetric Tensors (Forecast).
- New command line interfaces.
- Deprecated fvtk (old visualization framework).
- A range of new visualization improvements.
- Large documentation update.

Getting Started
***************

Here is a quick snippet showing how to calculate `color FA` also known as the
DEC map. We use a Tensor model to reconstruct the datasets which are
saved in a Nifti file along with the b-values and b-vectors which are saved as
text files. Finally, we save our result as a Nifti file ::

    fdwi = 'dwi.nii.gz'
    fbval = 'dwi.bval'
    fbvec = 'dwi.bvec'

    from dipy.io.image import load_nifti, save_nifti
    from dipy.io import read_bvals_bvecs
    from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
    from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel

    data, affine = load_nifti(fdwi)
    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)

    tenmodel = TensorModel(gtab)
    tenfit = tenmodel.fit(data)

    save_nifti('colorfa.nii.gz', tenfit.color_fa, affine)

As an exercise, you can try to calculate `color FA` with your datasets. You will need
to replace the filepaths `fimg`, `fbval` and `fbvec`. Here is what
a slice should look like.
