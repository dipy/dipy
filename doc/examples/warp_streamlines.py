====================================
Warp FA and streamlines to MNI space
====================================

In this example we show how to apply FSL deformations to FAs and streamlines
created by Dipy_. This is an example of non-linear registration.

This example requires to have FSL installed and added to your environment. In addition
it requires two source files that we created from example `tracking_eudx_tensor.py`:
'tensor_fa.nii.gz', and 'tensor_streamlines.trk' and a reference file which should be
the FA template image in MNI space.
