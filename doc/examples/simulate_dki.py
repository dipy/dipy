DKI MultiTensor Simulation
==========================

In this example we show how to simulate the Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI)
data of a single voxel. DKI captures information about the non-Gaussian
properties of water diffusion which is a consequence of the existence of tissue
barriers and compartments. In these simulations compartmental heterogeneity is
taken into account by modeling different compartments for the intra- and
extra-cellular media of two populations of fibers. These simulations are
performed according to [RNH2015]_.

We first import all relevant modules.

.. figure:: simulated_dki_signal.png
   :align: center

   Simulated signals obtain from the DTI and DKI models.

Non-Gaussian diffusion properties in tissues are responsible to smaller signal
attenuations for larger bvalues when compared to signal attenuations from free
Gaussian water diffusion. This feature can be shown from the figure above,
since signals simulated from the DKI models reveals larger DW signal
intensities than the signals obtained only from the diffusion tensor
components.
