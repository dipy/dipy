Creating a new workflow.
============================================================

A workflow is a series of DIPY_ operations with fixed inputs and outputs
that is callable via command line or another interface.

For example, after installing DIPY_, you can call anywhere from your command
line::

    dipy_nlmeans t1.nii.gz t1_denoised.nii.gz

First create your workflow (let's name this workflow file as my_workflow.py).
Usually this is a python file in the ``<../dipy/workflows>`` directory.

        ``AppendTextFlow`` is the name of our workflow. Note that it needs
        to extend Workflow for everything to work properly. It will append
        text to a file.

        It is mandatory to have out_dir as a parameter. It is also mandatory
        to put `out_` in front of every parameter that is going to be an
        output. Lastly, all `out_` params needs to be at the end of the params
        list.

        The ``run`` docstring is very important, you need to document every
        parameter as they will be used with inspection to build the command line
        argument parser.

# Use self.get_io_iterator() in every workflow you create. This creates
# an ``IOIterator`` object that create output file names and directory
# structure based on the inputs and some other advanced output strategy
# parameters.
#
# By iterating on the ``IOIterator`` object you created previously you
# conveniently get all input and output paths for every input file
# found when globbing the input parameters.
#
# The code in the loop is the actual workflow processing code. It can be
# anything. For example, it just appends text to an input file.
#
# This is it for the workflow! Now to be able to call it easily via command
# line, you need to add this workflow in 2 different files:
# - ``<dipy_root>/pyproject.toml``: open this file and add the following line
#   to the ``[project.scripts]`` section:
#   ``dipy_append_text = "dipy.workflows.cli:run"``
# - ``<dipy_root>/dipy/workflows/cli.py``: open this file and add the workflow
#   information to the ``cli_flows`` dictionary. The key is the name of the
#   command line command and the value is a tuple with the module name and the
#   workflow class name. In this case it would be:
#   ``"dipy_append_text": ("dipy.workflows.my_workflow", "AppendTextFlow")``
#
# That`s it! Now you can call your workflow from anywhere with the command line.
# Let's just call the script you just made with ``-h`` to see the argparser help
# text::
#
#    dipy_append_text --help
#
# You should see all your parameters available along with some extra common
# ones like logging file and force overwrite. Also all the documentation you
# wrote about each parameter is there.
