=====================================================
An introduction to the Probabilistic Direction Getter
=====================================================

Probabilistic fiber tracking is a way of reconstructing white matter
connections using diffusion MR imaging. Like deterministic fiber tracking, the
probabilistic approach follows the trajectory of a possible pathway step by
step starting at a seed, however, unlike deterministic tracking, the tracking
direction at each point along the path is chosen at random from a distribution.
The distribution at each point is different and depends on the observed
diffusion data at that point. The distribution of tracking directions at each
point can be represented as a probability mass function (PMF) if the possible
tracking directions are restricted to discrete numbers of well distributed
points on a sphere.

This example is an extension of the :ref:`example_tracking_introduction_eudx`
example. We'll begin by repeating a few steps from that example, loading the
data and fitting a Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) model.

The Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) of the CSD model estimates the
distribution of small fiber bundles within each voxel. We can use this
distribution for probabilistic fiber tracking. One way to do this is to
represent the FOD using a discrete sphere. This discrete FOD can be used by the
``ProbabilisticDirectionGetter`` as a PMF for sampling tracking directions. We
need to clip the FOD to use it as a PMF because the latter cannot have negative
values. Ideally, the FOD should be strictly positive, but because of noise
and/or model failures sometimes it can have negative values.

"""
One disadvantage of using a discrete PMF to represent possible tracking
directions is that it tends to take up a lot of memory (RAM). The size of the
PMF, the FOD in this case, must be equal to the number of possible tracking
directions on the hemisphere, and every voxel has a unique PMF. In this case
the data is ``(81, 106, 76)`` and ``small_sphere`` has 181 directions so the
FOD is ``(81, 106, 76, 181)``. One way to avoid sampling the PMF and holding it
in memory is to build the direction getter directly from the spherical harmonic
(SH) representation of the FOD. By using this approach, we can also use a
larger sphere, like ``default_sphere`` which has 362 directions on the
hemisphere, without having to worry about memory limitations.
