Creating a new combined workflow
================================

A ``CombinedWorkflow`` is a series of DIPY_ workflows organized together in a
way that the output of a workflow serves as input for the next one.

First create your ``CombinedWorkflow`` class. Your ``CombinedWorkflow`` class
file is usually located in the ``dipy/workflows`` directory.

        Just like a normal workflow, it is mandatory to have out_dir as a
        parameter. It is also mandatory to put 'out_' in front of every
        parameter that is going to be an output. Lastly, all out_ params needs
        to be at the end of the params list.

        The class docstring part is very important, you need to document
        every parameter as they will be used with inspection to build the
        command line argument parser.

# Use ``self.get_io_iterator()`` in every workflow you create. This creates
# an ``IOIterator`` object that create output file names and directory
# structure based on the inputs and some other advanced output strategy
# parameters.
#
# Iterating on the ``IOIterator`` object you created previously you
# conveniently get all input and output paths for every input file
# found when globbin the input parameters.
#
# In the ``IOIterator`` loop you can see how we create a new ``NLMeans``
# workflow then run it using ``self.run_sub_flow``. Running it this way will
# pass any workflow specific parameter that was retrieved from the command line
# and will append the ones you specify as optional parameters (``out_dir``
# in this case).
#
# Lastly, the outputs paths are retrieved using
# ``workflow.last_generated_outputs``. This allows to use ``denoise`` as the
# input for the ``MedianOtsuFlow``.
#
#
# This is it for the combined workflow class! Now to be able to call it easily
# via command line, you need to add this workflow in 2 different files:
#
# - ``<dipy_root>/pyproject.toml``: open this file and add the following line
#   to the ``[project.scripts]`` section:
#   ``dipy_denoise_segment = "dipy.workflows.cli:run"``
#
# - ``<dipy_root>/dipy/workflows/cli.py``: open this file and add the workflow
#   information to the ``cli_flows`` dictionary. The key is the name of the
#   command line command and the value is a tuple with the module name and the
#   workflow class name. In this case it would be:
#   ``"dipy_denoise_segment": ("dipy.workflows.my_combined_workflow",
#   "DenoiseAndSegment")``
#
# That`s it! Now you can call your workflow from anywhere with the command line.
# Let's just call the script you just made with ``-h`` to see the argparser help
# text::
#
#    dipy_denoise_segment --help
#
# You should see all your parameters available along with some extra common
# ones like logging file and force overwrite. Also all the documentation you
# wrote about each parameter is there.
