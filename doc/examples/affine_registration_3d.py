=========================
Affine Registration in 3D
=========================

This example explains how to compute an affine transformation to register two
3D volumes by maximization of their Mutual Information [Mattes03]_. The
optimization strategy is similar to that implemented in ANTS [Avants11]_.

We will do this twice. The first part of this tutorial will walk through the
details of the process with the object-oriented interface implemented in
the ``dipy.align`` module. The second part will use a simplified functional
interface.

This was just a translation of the moving image towards the static image, now
we will refine it by looking for an affine transform. We first create the
similarity metric (Mutual Information) to be used. We need to specify the
number of bins to be used to discretize the joint and marginal probability
distribution functions (PDF), a typical value is 32. We also need to specify
the percentage (an integer in (0, 100]) of voxels to be used for computing the
PDFs, the most accurate registration will be obtained by using all voxels, but
it is also the most time-consuming choice. We specify full sampling by passing
None instead of an integer

To avoid getting stuck at local optima, and to accelerate convergence, we use a
multi-resolution strategy (similar to ANTS [Avants11]_) by building a Gaussian
Pyramid. To have as much flexibility as possible, the user can specify how this
Gaussian Pyramid is built. First of all, we need to specify how many
resolutions we want to use. This is indirectly specified by just providing a
list of the number of iterations we want to perform at each resolution. Here we
will just specify 3 resolutions and a large number of iterations, 10000 at the
coarsest resolution, 1000 at the medium resolution and 100 at the finest. These

Using AffineRegistration we can register our images in as many stages as we
want, providing previous results as initialization for the next (the same logic
as in ANTS). The reason why it is useful is that registration is a non-convex
optimization problem (it may have more than one local optima), which means that
it is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. For
example, let's start with our (previously computed) rough transformation
aligning the centers of mass of our images, and then refine it in three stages.
First look for an optimal translation. The dictionary regtransforms contains
all available transforms, we obtain one of them by providing its name and the
dimension (either 2 or 3) of the image we are working with (since we are
aligning volumes, the dimension is 3)
