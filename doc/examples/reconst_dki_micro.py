=====================================================================
Reconstruction of the diffusion signal with the WMTI model
=====================================================================

DKI can also be used to derive concrete biophysical parameters by applying
microstructural models to DT and KT estimated from DKI. For instance,
Fieremans et al. [Fierem2011]_ showed that DKI can be used to
estimate the contribution of hindered and restricted diffusion for well-aligned
fibers - a model that was later referred to as the white matter tract integrity
WMTI technique [Fierem2013]_. The two tensors of WMTI can be also
interpreted as the influences of intra- and extra-cellular compartments and can
be used to estimate the axonal volume fraction and diffusion extra-cellular
tortuosity. According to previous studies [Fierem2012]_ [Fierem2013]_,
these latter measures can be used to distinguish processes of axonal loss from
processes of myelin degeneration.

In this example, we show how to process a dMRI dataset using
the WMTI model.

First, we import all relevant modules:
"""

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dipy.reconst.dki as dki
import dipy.reconst.dki_micro as dki_micro
from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
from dipy.data import get_fnames
from dipy.io.gradients import read_bvals_bvecs
from dipy.io.image import load_nifti
from dipy.segment.mask import median_otsu
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

"""
As the standard DKI, WMTI requires multi-shell data, i.e. data acquired from
more than one non-zero b-value. Here, we use a fetcher to download a
multi-shell dataset which was kindly provided by Hansen and Jespersen
(more details about the data are provided in their paper [Hansen2016]_).
"""

fraw, fbval, fbvec, t1_fname = get_fnames('cfin_multib')

data, affine = load_nifti(fraw)
bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)
gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)

"""
For comparison, this dataset is pre-processed using the same steps used in the
example for reconstructing DKI (see :ref:`example_reconst_dki`).
"""

# data masking
maskdata, mask = median_otsu(data, vol_idx=[0, 1], median_radius=4, numpass=2,
                             autocrop=False, dilate=1)

# Smoothing
fwhm = 1.25
gauss_std = fwhm / np.sqrt(8 * np.log(2))
data_smooth = np.zeros(data.shape)
for v in range(data.shape[-1]):
    data_smooth[..., v] = gaussian_filter(data[..., v], sigma=gauss_std)


"""
The WMTI model can be defined in DIPY by instantiating the
'KurtosisMicrostructureModel' object in the following way:
"""

dki_micro_model = dki_micro.KurtosisMicrostructureModel(gtab)

"""
Before fitting this microstructural model, it is useful to indicate the
regions in which this model provides meaningful information (i.e. voxels of
well-aligned fibers). Following Fieremans et al. [Fieremans2011]_, a simple way
to select this region is to generate a well-aligned fiber mask based on the
values of diffusion sphericity, planarity and linearity. Here we will follow
these selection criteria for a better comparison of our figures with the
original article published by Fieremans et al. [Fieremans2011]_. Nevertheless,
it is important to note that voxels with well-aligned fibers can be selected
based on other approaches such as using predefined regions of interest.
"""

# Diffusion Tensor is computed based on the standard DKI model
dkimodel = dki.DiffusionKurtosisModel(gtab)
dkifit = dkimodel.fit(data_smooth, mask=mask)

# Initialize well aligned mask with ones
well_aligned_mask = np.ones(data.shape[:-1], dtype='bool')

# Diffusion coefficient of linearity (cl) has to be larger than 0.4, thus
# we exclude voxels with cl < 0.4.
cl = dkifit.linearity.copy()
well_aligned_mask[cl < 0.4] = False

# Diffusion coefficient of planarity (cp) has to be lower than 0.2, thus
# we exclude voxels with cp > 0.2.
cp = dkifit.planarity.copy()
well_aligned_mask[cp > 0.2] = False

# Diffusion coefficient of sphericity (cs) has to be lower than 0.35, thus
# we exclude voxels with cs > 0.35.
cs = dkifit.sphericity.copy()
well_aligned_mask[cs > 0.35] = False

# Removing nan associated with background voxels
well_aligned_mask[np.isnan(cl)] = False
well_aligned_mask[np.isnan(cp)] = False
well_aligned_mask[np.isnan(cs)] = False

"""
Analogous to DKI, the data fit can be done by calling the ``fit`` function of
the model's object as follows:
"""

dki_micro_fit = dki_micro_model.fit(data_smooth, mask=well_aligned_mask)

"""
The KurtosisMicrostructureFit object created by this ``fit`` function can then
be used to extract model parameters such as the axonal water fraction and
diffusion hindered tortuosity:
"""

AWF = dki_micro_fit.awf
TORT = dki_micro_fit.tortuosity

"""
These parameters are plotted below on top of the mean kurtosis maps:
