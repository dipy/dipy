Advanced interactive visualization
==================================

In DIPY_ we created a thin interface to access many of the capabilities
available in the FURY 3D visualization library but tailored to the
needs of structural and diffusion imaging.
"""

import numpy as np
from dipy.viz import actor, window, ui

"""
In ``window`` we have all the objects that connect what needs to be rendered
to the display or the disk e.g., for saving screenshots. So, there you will
find key objects and functions like the ``Scene`` class which holds and
provides access to all the actors and the ``show`` function which displays what
is in the scene on a window. Also, this module provides access to functions
for opening/saving dialogs and printing screenshots (see ``snapshot``).

In the ``actor`` module we can find all the different primitives e.g.,
streamtubes, lines, image slices, etc.

In the ``ui`` module we have some other objects which allow to add buttons
and sliders and these interact both with windows and actors. Because of this
they need input from the operating system so they can process events.

Let's get started. In this tutorial, we will visualize some bundles
together with FA or T1. We will be able to change the slices using
a ``LineSlider2D`` widget.

First we need to fetch and load some datasets.
"""

The following function outputs a dictionary with the required bundles e.g. ``af
left`` (left arcuate fasciculus) and maps, e.g. FA for a specific subject.

We will use 3 bundles, FA and the affine transformation that brings the voxel
coordinates to world coordinates (RAS 1mm).

With our current design it is easy to decide in which space you want the
streamlines and slices to appear. The default we have here is to appear in
world coordinates (RAS 1mm).

If we want to see the objects in native space we need to make sure that all
objects which are currently in world coordinates are transformed back to
native space using the inverse of the affine.

function and an image plane using the ``slice`` function.

Now we would like to change the position of each ``image_actor`` using a
slider. The sliders are widgets which require access to different areas of the
visualization pipeline and therefore we don't recommend using them with
``show``. The more appropriate way is to use them with the ``ShowManager``
object which allows accessing the pipeline in different areas. Here is how:
"""

After we have initialized the ``ShowManager`` we can go ahead and create
sliders to move the slices and change their opacity.
