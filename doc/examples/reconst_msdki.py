Mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI)
==============================================

Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) is one of the conventional ways to estimate
the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion (see :ref:`example_reconst_dki`)
[Jensen2005]_. However, a limitation of DKI is that its measures are highly
sensitive to noise and image artefacts. For instance, due to the low radial
diffusivities, standard kurtosis estimates in regions of well-aligned voxel may
be corrupted by implausible low or even negative values.

A way to overcome this issue is to characterize kurtosis from average signals
across all directions acquired for each data b-value (also known as
powder-averaged signals). Moreover, as previously pointed [NetoHe2015]_,
standard kurtosis measures (e.g. radial, axial and standard mean kurtosis)
do not only depend on microstructural properties but also on mesoscopic
properties such as fiber dispersion or the intersection angle of crossing
fibers. In contrary, the kurtosis from powder-average signals has the advantage
of not depending on the fiber distribution functions [NetoHe2018]_,
[NetoHe2019]_.

In short, in this tutorial we show how to characterize non-Gaussian diffusion
in a more precise way and decoupled from confounding effects of tissue
dispersion and crossing.

In the first part of this example, we illustrate the properties of the measures
obtained from the mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI)[NetoHe2018]_
using synthetic data. Secondly, the mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging will
be applied to in-vivo MRI data. Finally, we show how MSDKI provides the same
information than common microstructural models such as the spherical mean
technique [NetoHe2019]_, [Kaden2016b]_.

We simulate representative diffusion-weighted signals using MultiTensor

produced based on the sum of four diffusion tensors to represent the intra-
and extra-cellular spaces of two fiber populations. The parameters of these
tensors are adjusted according to [NetoHe2015]_ (see also
:ref:`example_simulate_dki`).

   MSDKI and DKI measures for data of two crossing synthetic fibers.
   Upper panels show the MSDKI measures: 1) mean signal diffusivity (left
   panel); and 2) mean signal kurtosis (right panel).
   For reference, lower panels show the measures obtained by standard DKI:
   1) mean diffusivity (left panel); and 2) mean kurtosis (right panel).
   All estimates are plotted as a function of the intersecting angle of the
   two crossing fibers. Different curves correspond to different ground truth
   axonal volume fraction of intra-cellular space.

The results of the above figure, demonstrate that both MSD and MSK are
sensitive to axonal volume fraction (i.e. a microstructure property) but are
independent to the intersection angle of the two crossing fibers (i.e.
independent to properties regarding fiber orientation). In contrast, DKI
measures seem to be independent to both axonal volume fraction and
intersection angle.

   MSDKI measures (upper panels) and DKI standard measures (lower panels).

This figure shows that the contrast of in-vivo MSD and MSK maps (upper panels)
are similar to the contrast of MD and MSK maps (lower panels); however, in the
upper part we insure that direct contributions of fiber dispersion were
removed. The upper panels also reveal that MSDKI measures are let sensitive
to noise artefacts than standard DKI measures (as pointed by [NetoHe2018]_),
particularly one can observe that MSK maps always present positive values
in brain white matter regions, while implausible negative kurtosis values are
present in the MK maps in the same regions.

Relationship between MSDKI and SMT2
===================================
As showed in [NetoHe2019]_, MSDKI captures the same information than the
spherical mean technique (SMT) microstructural models [Kaden2016b]_. In this
way, the SMT model parameters can be directly computed from MSDKI.
For instance, the axonal volume fraction (f), the intrisic diffusivity (di),
and the microscopic anisotropy of the SMT 2-compartmental model [NetoHe2019]_
can be extracted using the following lines of code:
"""

F = msdki_fit.smt2f
DI = msdki_fit.smt2di
uFA2 = msdki_fit.smt2uFA

   SMT2 model quantities extracted from MSDKI. From left to right, the figure
   shows the axonal volume fraction (f), the intrinsic diffusivity (di), and
   the microscopic anisotropy of the SMT 2-compartmental model [NetoHe2019]_.

The similar contrast of SMT2 f-parameter maps in comparison to MSK (first panel
of Figure 3 vs second panel of Figure 2) confirms than MSK and F captures the
same tissue information but on different scales (but rescaled to values between
0 and 1).  It is important to note that SMT model parameters estimates should
be used with care, because the SMT model was shown to be invalid NetoHe2019]_.
For instance, although SMT2 parameter f and uFA may be a useful normalization
of the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion (note than both metrics have a range
between 0 and 1), these cannot be interpreted as a real biophysical estimates
of axonal water fraction and tissue microscopic anisotropy.
