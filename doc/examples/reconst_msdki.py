Mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI)
===============================================================================

Several microstructural models have been proposed to increase the specificity
of diffusion-weighted data; however, improper model assumptions are known to
compromise the validity of the model's estimates [NetoHe2019]_. To avoid
misleading interpretation, it might be enough to characterize
diffusion-weighted data using signal representation techniques. For example,
assuming that the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion decreases with tissue
degeneration, this can be sensitive to general microstructural alterations.
Although this cannot be used to distinguish different mechanisms of
microstructural changes (e.g. axonal loss vs demyelination), the degree of
non-Gaussian diffusion can provide insights on the general condition of tissue
microstructure and provide useful markers to understanding, for instance, the
relationship between brain microstructure changes and alterations in behaviour
(e.g. [Price2017]_).

Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging is one of the conventional ways to estimate the
degree of non-Gaussian diffusion (see :ref:`example_reconst_dki`). However,
as previously pointed [NetoHe2015]_, standard kurtosis measures do not only
depend on microstructural properties but also on mesoscopic properties such as
fiber dispersion or the intersection angle of crossing fibers.

In the following example, we show how one can process the diffusion kurtosis
from mean signals (also known as powder-averaged signals) and obtain a
characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion independently to the degree of fiber
organization [NetoHe2018]_. In the first part of this example, the properties
of the measures obtained from the mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging
[NetoHe2018]_ are illustrated using synthetic data. Secondly, the mean signal
diffusion kurtosis imaging will be applied to in-vivo MRI data.

   MSDKI and DKI measures for data of two crossing synthetic fibers.
   Upper panels show the MSDKI measures: 1) mean signal diffusivity (left
   panel); and 2) mean signal kurtosis (right panel).
   For reference, lower panels show the measures obtained by standard DKI:
   1) mean diffusivity (left panel); and 2) mean kurtosis (right panel).
   All estimates are plotted as a function of the intersecting angle of the
   two crossing fibers. Different curves correspond to different ground truth
   axonal volume fraction of intra-cellular space.

The results of the above figure, demonstrate that both MSD and MSK are
sensitive to axonal volume fraction (i.e. a microstructure property) but are
independent to the intersectiong angle of the two crossing fibers (i.e.
independent to properties regarding fiber orientation). In contrast, DKI
measures seem to be independent to both axonal volume fraction and
intersection angle.

   MSDKI measures (upper panels) and DKI standard measures (lower panels).

This figure shows that the contrast of in-vivo MSD and MSK maps (upper panels)
are similar to the contrast of MD and MSK maps (lower panels); however, in the
upper part we insure that direct contributions of fiber dispersion were
removed. The upper panels also reveal that MSDKI measures are let sensitive
to noise artefacts than standard DKI measures (as pointed by [NetoHe2018]_),
particularly one can appriciate that MSK maps always present positive values
in brain white matter regions, while implausible negative kurtosis values are
present in the MK maps in the same regions.
