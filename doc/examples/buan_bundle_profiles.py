================================
BUAN bundle profiles (lite)
================================

This example shows how to compute **weighted mean bundle profiles**
using the BUAN "lite" functionality.

Compared to full BUAN profiles (streamline-by-streamline), the lite version
summarizes each bundle into a mean profile, where each streamline contributes
according to a weight based on its distance to a model bundle centroid.

The output is useful for users who prefer working with **mean profiles**
while keeping BUAN-style along-tract segmentation.
