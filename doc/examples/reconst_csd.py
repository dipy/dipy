Reconstruction with Constrained Spherical Deconvolution
=======================================================

This example shows how to use Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)
introduced by Tournier et al. [Tournier2007]_.

This method is mainly useful with datasets with gradient directions acquired on
a spherical grid.

The basic idea with this method is that if we could estimate the response function of a
single fiber then we could deconvolve the measured signal and obtain the underlying
fiber distribution.

Lets first load the data. We will use a dataset with 10 b0s and 150 non-b0s with b-value 2000.

"""
You can verify the b-values of the datasets by looking at the attribute `gtab.bvals`.

In CSD there is an important pre-processing step: the estimation of the fiber response function. In order to
do this we look for voxel with very anisotropic configurations. For example here we use an ROI (20x20x20) at the center
of the volume and store the signal values for the voxels with FA values higher than 0.7. Of course, if we haven't
precalculated FA we need to fit a Tensor model to the datasets. Which is what we do here.

Using `gtab.b0s_mask()` we can find all the S0 volumes (which correspond to b-values equal 0) in the dataset.
