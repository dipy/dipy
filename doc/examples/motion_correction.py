=================================================
Between-volumes Motion Correction on DWI datasets
=================================================

Overview
--------
During a dMRI acquisition, the subject motion inevitable. This motion implies
a misalignment between N volumes on a dMRI dataset. A common way to solve this
issue is to perform a registration on each acquired volume to a
reference b = 0. [JenkinsonSmith01]_

This preprocessing is an highly recommended step that should be executed before
any dMRI dataset analysis.


Let's import some essential functions.
