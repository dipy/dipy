About Myself
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hey there! I'm Shilpi, a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. I'm on track to grab my degree in 2024.
My relationship with Python started just before I started college - got my hands dirty with this awesome Python Specialization course on Coursera. 
When it comes to what makes me tick, it's all things tech. I mean, new technology always excites me. Ubuntu, with its fancy terminal and all, used to intimidate me at first, but now, I get a thrill out of using it to do even the simplest things.
Up until 2nd year I used to do competitive programming and a bit of ML. But from 3rd year I've been into ML very seriously, doing several courses on ML as well solving ML problems on kaggle. ML is very fun and I've done a few project on ML as well. 
Coding? Absolutely love it. It's like, this is what I was meant to do, y'know? I got introduced to git and GitHub in my first year - was super curious about how the whole version control thing worked. And then, I stumbled upon the world of open source in my second year and made my first contribution to Tardis: (`https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pull/1825`)
Initially, I intended on doing GSoC during my second year but ended up stepping back for reasons. This time, though, I was fired up to send in a proposal to at least one organization in GSoC. And, well, here we are!


Intro to Open-Source and GSoC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, I started off finding out about GSoC - how many hours do selected folks put in, the kind of projects people usually tackle, and all that stuff. To get a handle on what they want in a proposal, I turned to some successful ones from previous years. Really gave me an idea of the kind of stuff they expect you to bring to the table.
Trying to find the organization that'd go with my skill set, I stumbled upon Python Software Foundation, and I was like, "This is it!". And under PSF, there was DIPY. 
Diving into DIPY's docs was a breeze as they've got it so well put together that I managed to get my head around a completely new topic, "Diffusion MRI", just by going through their introductory docs and a bit of gpt.
While exploring DIPY, I noticed this issue that needed a new feature. It took a good bit of reading to really understand what they were looking for and how to actually build that feature. And then, I submitted my first PR (`check it out here: https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/2749`)! Getting it merged wasn't exactly easy - there was a lot of room for improvement up in my code, but honestly, I feel like it's all part of the learning curve.
I was a bit of a latecomer to GSoC, so I didn't have much time to make up a ton of PRs. Plus, by the time I'd submitted my first PR, the proposal submission period had already begun. So, I focused all my energy on increasing my knowledge on the topic and polishing my proposal. Plus, I'd wanted to get my proposal reviewed at least once before I submitted it.

The Day
~~~~~~~

May 4th: I woke up feeling like a nervous wreck. That interview with my organization? Let's just say it didn't go very well. Yet, I couldn't help but hope for the best. The results were supposed to drop at 11:45pm, a moment I wasn't exactly looking forward to.
I tried logging into Google to check, but couldn't. Too many people doing the same thing. I threw my hands up, gave up on the login battle, and got back to work, hoping to distract myself.
Fast forward to 1:30am - I figured by now, the log-in rush should have calmed down. I gave it another shot and... I got in! I clicked over to the dashboard, and there it was. My project. Right there, listed under the Projects section. I had heard that if you get selected, your proposal shows up there.
To confirm that it was actually happening, I picked my phone to check if I'd gotten any official email yet. And yes!! I'd gotten it at 12:49 am. I just hadn't checked.
I whooped, woke up my roomies, rushed to call my parents.
Honestly, words can't even begin to capture how I felt at that moment. 
Pure, undiluted joy, that's what it was. My parents, surprisingly actually picked up my call. But the minute I told them I'd made the cut, they congratulated me. It was heck of a day, (^^).
