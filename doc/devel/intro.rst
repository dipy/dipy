how to get going.

Have a look at the `nipy development guidelines`_ for our coding habits.
In summary, please follow the `numpy coding style`_ - and of course -
PEP8_ .  Test everything!  We are using nose_ ; see the existing code
for example tests.  If you can please use our :ref:`commit-codes`.

But - just pitch in - send us some code - we'll give you feedback if you
want it - that way we learn from each other.

And - welcome...
