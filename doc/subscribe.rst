Dipy_ is a part of the Nipy_ community and we are happy to share the same
e-mail list. This makes sense as we can share ideas with a broader
community and boost collaboration across neuroimagers. If you
want to post to the list you will need first to subscribe to the `nipy
mailing list`_. We suggest to begin the subject of your e-mail with
``[Dipy]``. This will help us respond faster to your questions.

Additional help can be found on the Neurostars_ website, or
on the `dipy gitter`_ channel.
