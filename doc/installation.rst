Installation
############

dipy_ is in active development. You can install it from our latest release, but
you may find that the release has gotten well behind the current development -
at least - we hope so - if we're developing fast enough!

If you want install the latest and greatest from the bleeding edge of the
development, skip to :ref:`from-source`. If you just want to install a released
version, read on for your platform.

********************
Installing a release
********************

If you are on Debian or Ubuntu Linux we recommend you try
:ref:`install-packages` first. Otherwise please try :ref:`install-pip`.

.. _install-packages:

Using packages:
===============

Windows
-------

#. To use dipy_, you will need to install a few :ref:`dependencies`. One     simple way to get the dependencies on your machine, is to install the Anaconda_ python distribution, following the instructions on their website. Note that there are alternatives to Anaconda_. See below for :ref:`alternatives`.

#. You will still need to install the nibabel_ library, which supports reading and writing of neuroimaging data formats. You can install it from a binary installer on the `nibabel pypi`_ web page. Download the `.exe` installer in the table at the bottom and double-click it to launch the installation process.


#. Similarly, you can install dipy_ itself from the `dipy pypi`_ web-page. Download the `.exe` installer in the table at the bottom of the page and double-click it to launch the installation.

#. Now, you should be able to start using dipy_. From a python console or script try ::

    >>> import dipy

There are other alternatives than the one we have outlined above to installing the dependencies and to install nibabel_ and dipy_. In particular, you can use pip_ or  easy_install_ from the Anaconda Command Prompt (which you can launch from the Start Menu),
To do that, you would replace the instructions above with typing the following at the command prompt ::

    pip install nibabel
    pip install dipy

or ::

    easy_install nibabel
    easy_install dipy

#. Some of the visualization methods require the VTK_ library and this can be installed using Anaconda ::

     conda install vtk


OSX
---

#. To use dipy_, you need to have some :ref:`dependencies` installed. First of all, make sure that you have installed the Apple Xcode_ developer tools. You'll need those to install all the following dependencies.

#. Next, install the python library dependencies. One easy way to do that is to use the Anaconda_ distribution (see below for :ref:`alternatives`).

#. Even with Anaconda installed, you will still need to install the nibabel_ library, which supports reading and writing of neuroimaging data formats. Open a terminal and type ::

        pip install nibabel

#. Finally, we are ready to install 'dipy` itself. Same as with `nibabel` above, we will type at the terminal shell command line ::

        pip install dipy

When the installation has finished we can check if it is successful in the following way. From a Python console script try ::

    >>> import dipy

This should work with no error.

#. Some of the visualization methods require the VTK_ library and this can be installed using Anaconda ::

     conda install vtk

Linux
-----

For Debian, Ubuntu and Mint set up the NeuroDebian_ repositories - see
`NeuroDebian how to`_. Then::

    sudo apt-get install python-dipy

We hope to get packages for the other Linux distributions, but for now, please
try :ref:`install-pip` instead.


.. _install-pip:

Using pip:
==========

This method should work under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Please install numpy_ and scipy_ using their respective binary installers if
you haven't already.

For Windows and Mac OSX you can use Anaconda_ to get numpy, scipy, cython and lots
of other useful python module. Anaconda_ is a big package but will install many
tools and libraries that are useful for scientific processing.

When you have numpy, scipy and cython installed then try ::

    pip install nibabel
    pip install dipy

Then from any python console or script try ::

    >>> import dipy

Do these installation instructions work for you? For any problems/suggestions please let us know by sending us an e-mail to the `nipy mailing list`_ with the subject line starting with ``[dipy]``.

Common problems:
================

Multiple installations
----------------------

Make sure that you have uninstalled all previous versions of Dipy before installing a new one. A simple and general way to uninstall Dipy is by removing the installation directory. You can find where Dipy is installed by using::

    import dipy
    dipy.__file__

and then remove the Dipy directory that contains that file.

.. _alternatives:

Alternatives to Anaconda
-------------------------
If you have problems installing Anaconda_ we recommend using Canopy_ or pythonxy_.

Memory issues
-------------
Dipy can process large diffusion datasets. For this reason we recommend using a 64bit operating system which can allocate larger memory chunks than 32bit operating systems. If you don't have a 64bit computer that is okay Dipy works with 32bit too.

.. _python-versions:

Note on python versions
-----------------------

Dipy supports python 2.6+ and python 3+. We started supporting Python 3 from version dipy.0.7.0.

.. _from-source:

**********************
Installing from source
**********************

Getting the source
==================

More likely you will want to get the source repository to be able to follow the
latest changes.  In that case, you can use::

    git clone https://github.com/nipy/dipy.git

For more information about this see :ref:`following-latest`.

After you've cloned the repository, you will have a new directory, containing
the dipy ``setup.py`` file, among others.  We'll call this directory - that
contains the ``setup.py`` file - the *dipy source root directory*.  Sometimes
we'll also call it the ``<dipy root>`` directory.

Building and installing
=======================

Windows
-------

Anaconda_ is probably the easiest way to install the dependencies that you need.

Start a command shell like ``cmd`` or Powershell_ and change directory into the
*dipy source root directory*.

To install into your system::

    python setup.py install --compiler=mingw32

To install inplace - so that dipy is running out of the source code directory::

    python setup.py develop

(this is the mode we recommend for following the latest source code).  If you
get an error with ``python setup.py develop`` make sure you have installed
`setuptools`_.

If you get an error saying  "unable to find vcvarsall.bat" then you need to
create a file called "pydistutils.cfg" in notepad and give it the contents ::

  [build]
  compiler=mingw32

Save this into your system python ``distutils`` directory as ``distutils.cfg``.
This will be something like ``C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg``.


OSX
---

Make sure you have Xcode_ and Anaconda_ installed.

From here follow the :ref:`install-source-nix` instructions.

OpenMP with OSX
---------------
OpenMP is a standard library used in Dipy for efficient multithreaded
applications (e.g. denoising and bundle registration). OpenMP is again
supported by default after OSX 10.11 (El Capitan). If you have a version that
does not support OpenMP then you need first to compile the library following
these instructions http://openmp.llvm.org and then build Dipy. If you don't do
this then you will use only one core and some of the algorithms will not run
in parallel.


Ubuntu/Debian
-------------

::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
    sudo apt-get install cython

then::

    sudo pip install nibabel

(we need the latest version of these two - hence ``easy_install`` rather than
``apt-get``).

You might want the optional packages too (highly recommended)::

    sudo apt-get install ipython python-tables python-vtk python-matplotlib

Now follow :ref:`install-source-nix`.

Fedora / Mandriva maybe Redhat
------------------------------

Same as above but use yum rather than apt-get when necessary.

Now follow :ref:`install-source-nix`.

.. _install-source-nix:

Install from source for Unix (e.g Linux, OSX)
---------------------------------------------

Change directory into the *dipy source root directory* .

To install for the system::

    python setup.py install

To build dipy in the source tree (locally) so you can run the code in the source tree (recommended for following the latest source) run::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

add the *dipy source root directory* into your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. Search google for ``PYTHONPATH`` for details or see `python module path`_ for an introduction.

When adding dipy_ to the ``PYTHONPATH``, we usually add the ``PYTHONPATH`` at
the end of ``~/.bashrc`` or (OSX) ``~/.bash_profile`` so we don't need to
retype it every time. This should look something like::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/user_dir/Devel/dipy:/home/user_dir/Devel/nibabel

After changing the ``~/.bashrc`` or (OSX) ``~/.bash_profile`` try::

  source ~/.bashrc

or::

  source ~/.bash_profile

so that you can have immediate access to dipy_ without needing to
restart your terminal.

Testing
========

If you want to run the tests::

    sudo pip install nose

Then (in python or ipython_)::

    >>> import dipy
    >>> dipy.test()

You can also run the examples in ``<dipy root>/doc``.

Documentation (Unix only)
=========================

To build the documentation in HTML in your computer you will need to do::

    sudo pip install sphinx

Then change directory to ``<dipy root>`` and::

    cd doc
    make clean
    make html


.. include:: links_names.inc
