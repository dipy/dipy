============================
A quick overview of features
============================

Here are just a few of the state-of-the-art technologies and algorithms which are provided in Dipy_:

- Reconstruction algorithms e.g. DSI, GQI, DTI, QBI.
- Fiber tracking algorithms e.g. EuDX.
- Intelligent downsampling/compression of streamlines.
- Fast tractography clustering using QuickBundles.
- Reslice datasets with anisotropic voxels to isotropic.
- Calculate distances/correspondences between streamlines of different brains.
- Deal with huge tractographies without memory restrictions (.dpy).

With the help of some external tools you can also:

- Warp/Register tractographies into another space e.g. MNI space.
- Read many different file formats e.g. Trackvis or Nifti.
- Examine your datasets interactively (with ipython).
