Here is a quick snippet showing how to calculate `color FA` also known as the
DEC map. We use a Tensor model to reconstruct the datasets which are
saved in a Nifti file along with the b-values and b-vectors which are saved as
text files. Finally, we save our result as a Nifti file ::

    fdwi = 'dwi.nii.gz'
    fbval = 'dwi.bval'
    fbvec = 'dwi.bvec'

    from dipy.io.image import load_nifti, save_nifti
    from dipy.io import read_bvals_bvecs
    from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
    from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel

    data, affine = load_nifti(fdwi)
    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(fbval, fbvec)
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs=bvecs)

    tenmodel = TensorModel(gtab)
    tenfit = tenmodel.fit(data)

    save_nifti('colorfa.nii.gz', tenfit.color_fa, affine)

As an exercise, you can try to calculate `color FA` with your datasets. You will need
to replace the filepaths `fdwi`, `fbval` and `fbvec`. Here is what
a slice should look like.
