# Summary

The intra­-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a model that describes diffusion
and perfusion in the signal acquired with pulsed-gradient spin echo MRI
experiments [@le1986mr]. This method was originally developed to study the
motion of water molecules in the human brain -- an indication of brain
microstructure, and brain health more generally. But more recently, interest in
this model has expanded and applications have emerged throughout the body
[@LeBihan2008] including kidneys, liver, and heart [@Powers1991, @PMID:9038058,
@Callot2003, ]. Many more applications are now under investigation such as
imaging for cancer (prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, etc.) [@Koh2011] and
imaging of human placenta [@Moore2000, @moore2000vivo]. Still, one of its mort
common applications is in brain mapping neuroscience research
[@Federau2012]. For example in research on Parkinson’s disease, where it is
used to study aging and structural degeneration of fibre pathways in the brain
[@CRUZ2014].
