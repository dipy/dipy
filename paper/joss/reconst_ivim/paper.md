# Summary

Intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a biophysical model that describes diffusion
and perfusion in the signal acquired with a multi-diffusion value MRI
acquisition [@le1986mr]. This method was originally developed to study the
fast and slow motion of water molecules in the human brain -- an indication of brain
microstructure, and brain health more generally. But more recently, interest in
this model has expanded and applications have emerged throughout the body
[@LeBihan2008] including kidneys, liver, and heart [@Powers1991, @PMID:9038058,
@Callot2003, ]. Many more applications are now under investigation such as
cancer imaging (prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, etc.) [@Koh2011] and
imaging of the human placenta [@Moore2000, @moore2000vivo]. One of its most
common applications still remains brain mapping for neuroscience research
[@Federau2012]. An example of this is Parkinsonâ€™s disease, where it is
used to study aging and structural degeneration of fibre pathways in the brain
[@CRUZ2014].
