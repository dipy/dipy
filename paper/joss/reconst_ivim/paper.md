# Summary

Intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a technique that aims to separate effects of perfusion (microcirculation of blood in the capillary network) from the effects of molecular diffusion in MRI images acquired with a multi-diffusion weights [@le1986mr, @le1988ra]. This method was originally developed to study perfusion and diffusion in the human brain [@le1986mr], but more recently, interest in this technique has expanded and applications have emerged throughout the body [@LeBihan2008] including kidneys, liver, and heart [@Powers1991, @PMID:9038058, @Callot2003, ]. Many more applications are now under investigation such as cancer imaging (prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, etc.) [@Koh2011] and imaging of the human placenta [@Moore2000, @moore2000vivo]. One of its most common applications still remains brain mapping for neuroscience research
[@Federau2012]. An example of this is Parkinsonâ€™s disease, where it is used to study aging and structural degeneration of fibre pathways in the brain [@CRUZ2014].
