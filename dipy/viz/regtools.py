    Draws a diffeomorphic map by showing the effect of the deformation on a
    regular grid. The resulting figure contains two images: the direct
    transformation is plotted to the left, and the inverse transformation is
    plotted to the right.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mapping : DiffeomorphicMap object
        the diffeomorphic map to be drawn
    delta : int, optional
        the size (in pixels) of the squares of the regular lattice to be used
        to plot the warping effects. Each square will be delta x delta pixels.
        By default, the size will be 10 pixels.
    fname : string, optional
        the name of the file the figure will be written to. If None (default),
        the figure will not be saved to disk.
    direct_grid_shape : tuple, shape (2,), optional
        the shape of the grid image after being deformed by the direct
        transformation. By default, the shape of the deformed grid is the
        same as the grid of the displacement field, which is by default
        equal to the shape of the fixed image. In other words, the resulting
        deformed grid (deformed by the direct transformation) will normally
        have the same shape as the fixed image.
    direct_grid2world : array, shape (3, 3), optional
        the affine transformation mapping the direct grid's coordinates to
        physical space. By default, this transformation will correspond to
        the image-to-world transformation corresponding to the default
        direct_grid_shape (in general, if users specify a direct_grid_shape,
        they should also specify direct_grid2world).
    inverse_grid_shape : tuple, shape (2,), optional
        the shape of the grid image after being deformed by the inverse
        transformation. By default, the shape of the deformed grid under the
        inverse transform is the same as the image used as "moving" when
        the diffeomorphic map was generated by a registration algorithm
        (so it corresponds to the effect of warping the static image towards
        the moving).
    inverse_grid2world : array, shape (3, 3), optional
        the affine transformation mapping inverse grid's coordinates to
        physical space. By default, this transformation will correspond to
        the image-to-world transformation corresponding to the default
        inverse_grid_shape (in general, if users specify an inverse_grid_shape,
        they should also specify inverse_grid2world).
    show_figure : bool, optional
        if True (default), the deformed grids will be ploted using matplotlib,
        else the grids are just returned

    Returns
    -------
    warped_forward : array
        Image with grid showing the effect of transforming the moving image to
        the static image.  Shape will be `direct_grid_shape` if specified,
        otherwise the shape of the static image.
    warped_backward : array
        Image with grid showing the effect of transforming the static image to
        the moving image.  Shape will be `inverse_grid_shape` if specified,
        otherwise the shape of the moving image.

    Note
    ----
    The default value for the affine transformation is "-1" to handle the case
    in which the user provides "None" as input meaning "identity". If we used
    None as default, we wouldn't know if the user specifically wants to use
    the identity (specifically passing None) or if it was left unspecified,
    meaning to use the apropriate default matrix.
