        Parameters
        ----------
        cell_padding : 2-tuple of float or float (optional)
            Each grid cell will be padded according to (pad_x, pad_y) i.e.
            horizontally and vertically. Padding is evenly distributed on each
            side of the cell. If a single float is provided then both pad_x and
            pad_y will have the same value.
        cell_shape : {'rect', 'square', 'diagonal'} (optional)
            Specifies the desired shape of every grid cell.
            'rect' ensures the cells are the tightest.
            'square' ensures the cells are as wide as high.
            'diagonal' ensures the content of the cells can be rotated without
                       colliding with content of the neighboring cells.
        aspect_ratio : float (optional)
            Aspect ratio of the grid (width/height). Default: 16:9.
        dim : tuple of int (optional)
            Dimension (nb_rows, nb_cols) of the grid. If provided,
            `aspect_ratio` will be ignored.
