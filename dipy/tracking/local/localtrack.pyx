    This function is the main workhorse of the ``LocalTracking`` class defined

    Parameters
    ----------
    dg : DirectionGetter
        Used to choosing tracking directions.
    tc : TissueClassifier
        Used to check tissue type along path.
    seed : array, float, 1d, (3,)
        First point of the (partial) streamline.
    first_step : array, float, 1d, (3,)
        Used as ``prev_dir`` for selecting the step direction from the seed
        point.
    voxel_size : array, float, 1d, (3,)
        Size of voxels in the data set.
    streamline : array, float, 2d, (N, 3)
        Output of tracking will be put into this array. The length of this
        array, ``N``, will set the maximum allowable length of the streamline.
    stepsize : float
        Size of tracking steps in mm if ``fixed_step``.
    fixedstep : bool
        If true, a fixed stepsize is used, otherwise a variable step size is
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    end : int
        This function updates the ``streamline`` array with points as it
        tracks. Points in ``streamline[:abs(end)]`` were updated by the
        function. The sign of ``end`` and whether the last point was included
        depend on the reason that the streamline was terminated.

        End reasons:
            1) maximum length of the streamline was reached.
                ``end == N``
            2) ``direction_getter`` could not return a direction.
                ``end > 0``
                Last point is the point at which no direction could be found.
            3) Streamline encountered an ENDPOINT.
                ``end > 0``
                Last point is the ENDPOINT.
            3) Streamline encountered an OUTSIDEIMAGE.
                ``end > 0``
                Last point is the point before OUTSIDEIMAGE.
            5) Streamline encountered an INVALIDPOINT.
                ``end < 0``
                Last point is INVALIDPOINT.
