def detect_corresponding_tracks(indices, tracks1, tracks2):
    ''' Detect corresponding tracks from list tracks1 to list tracks2
    where tracks1 & tracks2 are lists of tracks

    Parameters
    ------------
    indices : sequence
       of indices of tracks1 that are to be detected in tracks2
    tracks1 : sequence
       of tracks as arrays, shape (N1,3) .. (Nm,3)
    tracks2 : sequence
       of tracks as arrays, shape (M1,3) .. (Mm,3)

    Returns
    ---------
    track2track : array (N,2) where N is len(indices) of int
       it shows the correspondance in the following way:
       the first column is the current index in tracks1
       the second column is the corresponding index in tracks2

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import dipy.tracking.learning as tl
    >>> A = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]])
    >>> B = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]])
    >>> C = np.array([[0, 0, -1], [0, 0, -2], [0, 0, -3]])
    >>> bundle1 = [A, B, C]
    >>> bundle2 = [B, A]
    >>> indices = [0, 1]
    >>> arr = tl.detect_corresponding_tracks(indices, bundle1, bundle2)

    Notes
    -------
    To find the corresponding tracks we use mam_distances with 'avg' option.
    Then we calculate the argmin of all the calculated distances and return it
    for every index. (See 3rd column of arr in the example given below.)
