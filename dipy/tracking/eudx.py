    '''Euler Delta Crossings

    Generates tracks with termination criteria defined by a delta function [1]_
    and it has similarities with FACT algorithm [2]_ and Basser's method
    but uses trilinear interpolation.

    Can be used with any reconstruction method as DTI, DSI, QBI, GQI which can
    calculate an orientation distribution function and find the local peaks of
    that function. For example a single tensor model can give you only
    one peak a dual tensor model 2 peaks and quantitative anisotropy
    method as used in GQI can give you 3,4,5 or even more peaks.

    The parameters of the delta function are checking thresholds for the
    direction propagation magnitude and the angle of propagation.

    A specific number of seeds is defined randomly and then the tracks
    are generated for that seed if the delta function returns true.

    Trilinear interpolation is being used for defining the weights of
    the propagation.

    Notes
    -----
    The coordinate system of the tractography is that of native space of image
    coordinates not native space world coordinates therefore voxel size is
    always considered as having size (1,1,1).  Therefore, the origin is at the
    center of the center of the first voxel of the volume and all i,j,k
    coordinates start from the center of the voxel they represent.

        Parameters
        ------------
        a : array,
            Shape (I, J, K, Np), magnitude of the peak of a scalar anisotropic
            function e.g. QA (quantitative anisotropy) where Np is the number
            of peaks or a different function of shape (I, J, K) e.g FA or GFA.
        ind : array, shape(x, y, z, Np)
            indices of orientations of the scalar anisotropic peaks found on
            the resampling sphere
        seeds : int or ndarray
            If an int is specified then that number of random seeds is
            generated in the volume. If an (N, 3) array of points is given,
            each of the N points is used as a seed. Seed points should be given
            in the point space of the track (see ``affine``). The latter is
            useful when you need to track from specific regions e.g. the
            white/gray matter interface or a specific ROI e.g. in the corpus
            callosum.
        odf_vertices : ndarray, shape (N, 3)
            sphere points which define a discrete representation of
            orientations for the peaks, the same for all voxels. Usually the
            same sphere is used as an input for a reconstruction algorithm
            e.g. DSI.
        a_low : float, optional
            low threshold for QA(typical 0.023)  or FA(typical 0.2) or any
            other anisotropic function
        step_sz : float, optional
            euler propagation step size
        ang_thr : float, optional
            if turning angle is bigger than this threshold then tracking stops.
        total_weight : float, optional
            total weighting threshold
        max_points : int, optional
            maximum number of points in a track. Used to stop tracks from
            looping forever.
        affine : array (4, 4) optional
            An affine mapping from the voxel indices of the input data to the
            point space of the streamlines. That is if ``[x, y, z, 1] ==
            point_space * [i, j, k, 1]``, then the streamline with point
            ``[x, y, z]`` passes though the center of voxel ``[i, j, k]``. If
            no point_space is given, the point space will be in voxel
            coordinates.

        Returns
        -------
        generator : obj
            By iterating this generator you can obtain all the streamlines.


        Examples
        --------
        >>> import nibabel as nib
        >>> from dipy.reconst.dti import TensorModel, quantize_evecs
        >>> from dipy.data import get_data, get_sphere
        >>> from dipy.core.gradients import gradient_table
        >>> fimg,fbvals,fbvecs = get_data('small_101D')
        >>> img = nib.load(fimg)
        >>> affine = img.get_affine()
        >>> data = img.get_data()
        >>> gtab = gradient_table(fbvals, fbvecs)
        >>> model = TensorModel(gtab)
        >>> ten = model.fit(data)
        >>> sphere = get_sphere('symmetric724')
        >>> ind = quantize_evecs(ten.evecs, sphere.vertices)
        >>> eu = EuDX(a=ten.fa, ind=ind, seeds=100, odf_vertices=sphere.vertices, a_low=.2)
        >>> tracks = [e for e in eu]

        Notes
        -------
        This works as an iterator class because otherwise it could fill your
        entire memory if you generate many tracks.  Something very common as
        you can easily generate millions of tracks if you have many seeds.
