    Probabilistic Identification and Estimation of Noise (PIESNO)
    A routine for finding the underlying gaussian distribution standard
    deviation from magnitude signals.

    This is a re-implementation of [1]_ and the second step in the
    stabilisation framework of [2]_.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : ndarray
        The magnitude signals to analyse. The last dimension must contain the
        same realisation of the volume, such as dMRI or fMRI data.

    N : int
        The number of phase array coils of the MRI scanner.
        If your scanner does a SENSE reconstruction, ALWAYS use N=1, as the noise
        profile is always Rician.
        If your scanner does a GRAPPA reconstruction, set N as the number
        of phase array coils.


    alpha : float
        Probabilistic estimation threshold for the gamma function.

    l : int
        number of initial estimates for sigma to try.

    itermax : int
        Maximum number of iterations to execute if convergence
        is not reached.

    eps : float
        Tolerance for the convergence criterion. Convergence is
        reached if two subsequent estimates are smaller than eps.

    return_mask : bool
        If True, return a mask identyfing all the pure noise voxel
        that were found.

    Returns
    --------
    sigma : float
        The estimated standard deviation of the gaussian noise.

    mask (optional): ndarray
        A boolean mask indicating the voxels identified as pure noise.

    Note
    ------
    This function assumes two things : 1. The data has a noisy, non-masked
    background and 2. The data is a repetition of the same measurements
    along the last axis, i.e. dMRI or fMRI data, not structural data like T1/T2.

    This function processes the data slice by slice, but makes a global
    estimation of the noise. Use piesno_3D to get a slice by slice estimation
    of the noise, as in spinal cord imaging for example.
