Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration
====================================
This examples explain how to register 2D images and 3D volumes using
the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm proposed by Avants et al.
[citation needed] (also implemented in the ANTS [citation needed] software)

The first example shows how to register two 2D images. We will use the classic
Circle-To-C experiment for diffeomorphic registration

Symmetric diffeomorphisms are represented as displacement fields (one 
displacement vector for each voxel), which may consume significant amount 
of memory. It is generaly a good idea to use 32-bit precision to save memory.
The 'floating' type is defined in the init file of the align module

The first decision we need to make is what similarity metric is appropriate
for our problem. In this example we are using two binary images, so the Sum
of Squared Differences (SSD) is a good choice. We create a metric specifying
2 as the dimension of our images' domain

Now we define an instance of the optimizer of the metric. The SyN algorithm uses
a multi-resolution approach by building a Gaussian Pyramid. We instruct the
optimizer to perform at most [n_0, n_1, ..., n_k] iterations at each level of
the pyramid. The 0-th level corresponds to the finest resolution.

that can be used to register images back and forth between the static and moving
domains

It is a good idea to visualize the resulting deformation map to make sure the
result is reasonable (at least, visually)
