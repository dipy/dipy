def get_direction_and_spacings(affine, dim):

    Extracts the rotational and spacing (voxel dimensions) components from a
    matrix. An image gradient represents the local variation of the image's
    gray values per voxel. Since we are iterating on the physical space, we
    need to compute the gradients as variation per millimeter, so we need to
    divide each gradient's component by the voxel size along the corresponding
    axis, that's what the spacings are used for. Since the image's gradients
    are oriented along the grid axes, we also need to re-orient the gradients
    to be given in physical space coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    affine : array, shape (k, k), k = 3, 4
        the matrix transforming grid coordinates to physical space.

        Notes
        -----

        A diffeomorphic map must be thought as a mapping between points
        in space. Warping an image J towards an image I means transforming
        each voxel with (discrete) coordinates i in I to (floating-point) voxel
        coordinates j in J. The transformation we consider 'forward' is
        precisely mapping coordinates i from the input image to coordinates j
        from reference image, which has the effect of warping an image with
        reference discretization (typically, the "static image") "towards" an
        image with input discretization (typically, the "moving image"). More
        precisely, the warped image is produced by the following interpolation:

        warped[i] = image[W * forward[Dinv * P * S * i] + W * P * S * i )]

        where i denotes the coordinates of a voxel in the input grid, W is
        the world-to-grid transformation of the image given as input, Dinv
        is the world-to-grid transformation of the deformation field
        discretization, P is the pre-aligning matrix (transforming input
        points to reference points), S is the voxel-to-space transformation of
        the sampling grid (see comment below) and forward is the forward
        deformation field.

        If we want to warp an image, we also must specify on what grid we
        want to sample the resulting warped image (the images are considered as
        points in space and its representation on a grid depends on its
        grid-to-space transform telling us for each grid voxel what point in
        space we need to bring via interpolation). So, S is the matrix that
        converts the sampling grid (whose shape is given as parameter
        'out_shape' ) to space coordinates.

        Notes
        -----

        A diffeomorphic map must be thought as a mapping between points
        in space. Warping an image J towards an image I means transforming
        each voxel with (discrete) coordinates i in I to (floating-point) voxel
        coordinates j in J. The transformation we consider 'backward' is
        precisely mapping coordinates i from the reference grid to coordinates
        j from the input image (that's why it's "backward"), which has the
        effect of warping the input image (moving) "towards" the reference.
        More precisely, the warped image is produced by the following
        interpolation:

        warped[i]=image[W * Pinv * backward[Dinv * S * i] + W * Pinv * S * i )]

        where i denotes the coordinates of a voxel in the input grid, W is
        the world-to-grid transformation of the image given as input, Dinv
        is the world-to-grid transformation of the deformation field
        discretization, Pinv is the pre-aligning matrix's inverse (transforming
        reference points to input points), S is the grid-to-space
        transformation of the sampling grid (see comment below) and backward is
        the backward deformation field.

        If we want to warp an image, we also must specify on what grid we
        want to sample the resulting warped image (the images are considered as
        points in space and its representation on a grid depends on its
        grid-to-space transform telling us for each grid voxel what point in
        space we need to bring via interpolation). So, S is the matrix that

        Starts the optimization

        Parameters
        ----------
        static : array, shape (S, R, C) or (R, C)
            the image to be used as reference during optimization. The
            displacement fields will have the same discretization as the static
            image.
        moving : array, shape (S, R, C) or (R, C)
            the image to be used as "moving" during optimization. Since the
            deformation fields' discretization is the same as the static image,
            it is necessary to pre-align the moving image to ensure its domain
            lies inside the domain of the deformation fields. This is assumed
            to be accomplished by "pre-aligning" the moving image towards the
            static using an affine transformation given by the 'prealign'
            matrix
        static_grid2world : array, shape (dim+1, dim+1)
            the voxel-to-space transformation associated to the static image
        moving_grid2world : array, shape (dim+1, dim+1)
            the voxel-to-space transformation associated to the moving image
        prealign : array, shape (dim+1, dim+1)
            the affine transformation (operating on the physical space)
            pre-aligning the moving image towards the static

        Returns
        -------
        static_to_ref : DiffeomorphicMap object
            the diffeomorphic map that brings the moving image towards the
            static one in the forward direction (i.e. by calling
            static_to_ref.transform) and the static image towards the
            moving one in the backward direction (i.e. by calling
