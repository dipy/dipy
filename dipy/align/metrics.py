        A similarity metric is in charge of keeping track of the numerical value
        of the similarity (or distance) between the two given images. It also
        computes the update field for the forward and inverse displacement 
        fields to be used in a gradient-based optimization algorithm. Note that
        this metric does not depend on any transformation (affine or non-linear)
        so it assumes the static and moving images are already warped

    Multi-resolution Gauss-Seidel solver: solves the linear system by first
    filtering (GS-iterate) the current level, then solves for the residual
    at a coarcer resolution andfinally refines the solution at the current
    resolution. This scheme corresponds to the V-cycle proposed by Bruhn and
    Weickert[1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        number of levels of the multi-resolution algorithm (it will be called
        recursively until level n==0)
    k : int 
        the number of iterations at each multi-resolution level
    delta_field : array, shape (R, C)
        the difference between the static and moving image (the 'derivatice
        w.r.t. time' in the optical flow model)
    sigma_field : array, shape (R, C)
        the variance of the gray level value at each voxel, according to the 
        EM model (for SSD, it is 1 for all voxels). Inf and 0 values
        are processed specially to support infinite and zero variance.
    gradient_field : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        the gradient of the moving image
    target : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        right-hand side of the linear system to be solved in the Weickert's
        multiresolution algorithm
    lambda_param : float
        smoothness parameter, the larger its value the smoother the displacement
        field
    displacement : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        the displacement field to start the optimization from

    Returns
    -------
    energy : the energy of the EM (or SSD if sigmafield[...]==1) metric at this 
        iteration
