    Computes the demons step [Vercauteren09] for SSD-driven registration
    ( eq. 4 in [Vercauteren09] ) using the EM algorithm [Arce14] to handle
    multi-modality images.

    In this case, $\sigma_i$ in eq. 4 of [Vercauteren] is estimated using the EM
    algorithm, while in the original version of diffeomorphic demons it is
    estimated by the difference between the image values at each pixel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta_field : array, shape (R, C)
        contains, at each pixel, the difference between the moving image (warped
        under the current deformation s(. , .) ) J and the static image I:
        delta_field[i,j] = J(s(i,j)) - I(i,j). The order is important, changing
        to delta_field[i,j] = I(i,j) - J(s(i,j)) yields the backward demons step
        warping the static image towards the moving, which may not be the
        intended behavior unless the 'gradient_moving' passed corresponds to
        the gradient of the static image
    sigma_sq_field : array, shape (R, C)
        contains, at each pixel (i, j), the estimated variance (not std) of the
        hidden variable associated to the intensity at static[i,j] (which must
        have been previously quantized)
    gradient_moving : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        the gradient of the moving image
    sigma_sq_x : float
        parameter controlling the amount of regularization. It corresponds to
        $\sigma_x^2$ in algorithm 1 of Vercauteren et al.[2]
    out : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        the resulting demons step will be written to this array

    Returns
    -------
    demons_step : array, shape (R, C, 2)
        the demons step to be applied for updating the current displacement
        field
    energy : float
        the current em energy (before applying the returned demons_step)

    r"""Demons step for EM metric in 3D

    Computes the demons step [Vercauteren09] for SSD-driven registration
    ( eq. 4 in [Vercauteren09] ) using the EM algorithm [Arce14] to handle
    multi-modality images.

    In this case, $\sigma_i$ in eq. 4 of [Vercauteren09] is estimated using
    the EM algorithm, while in the original version of diffeomorphic demons
    it is estimated by the difference between the image values at each pixel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta_field : array, shape (S, R, C)
        contains, at each pixel, the difference between the moving image (warped
        under the current deformation s ) J and the static image I:
        delta_field[k,i,j] = J(s(k,i,j)) - I(k,i,j). The order is important,
        changing to delta_field[k,i,j] = I(k,i,j) - J(s(k,i,j)) yields the
        backward demons step warping the static image towards the moving, which
        may not be the intended behavior unless the 'gradient_moving' passed
        corresponds to the gradient of the static image
    sigma_sq_field : array, shape (S, R, C)
        contains, at each pixel (k, i, j), the estimated variance (not std) of
        the hidden variable associated to the intensity at static[k,i,j] (which
        must have been previously quantized)
    gradient_moving : array, shape (S, R, C, 2)
        the gradient of the moving image
    sigma_sq_x : float
        parameter controlling the amount of regularization. It corresponds to
        $\sigma_x^2$ in algorithm 1 of Vercauteren et al.[2].
    out : array, shape (S, R, C, 2)
        the resulting demons step will be written to this array

    Returns
    -------
    demons_step : array, shape (S, R, C, 3)
        the demons step to be applied for updating the current displacement
        field
    energy : float
        the current em energy (before applying the returned demons_step)
