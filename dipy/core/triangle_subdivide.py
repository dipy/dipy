"""Create a unit sphere by subdividing all triangles of an octahedron
recursively.

The unit sphere has a radius of 1, which also means that all points in this
sphere (assumed to have centre at [0, 0, 0]) have an absolute value (modulus)
of 1. Another feature of the unit sphere is that the unit normals of this
sphere are exactly the same as the vertices.

This recursive method will avoid the common problem of the polar singularity, 
produced by 2d (lon-lat) parameterization methods.

If you require a sphere with a radius other than that of 1, simply multiply
the vertex array by this new radius (although this will break the "vertex array
equal to unit normal array" property)

def _divide_all( vertices, edges, triangles ):
    r""" Subdivides triangles into smaller triangles

    Parameters
    ------------
    vertices : ndarray
        A Vx3 array with the x, y, and z coordinates of of each vertex.
    edges : ndarray
        An Ex2 array of edges where each edge is a pair of neighboring
        vertices.
    triangles : ndarray
        A Tx3 array of triangles, where each triangle is a set of three edges.

    Returns
    ---------
    vertices : ndarray
        like above
    edges : ndarray
        like above
    triangles : ndarray
        like above

    Important Note on Cycle Rule:
    -----------------------------
    The edges and triangles that are passed to this function must follow the
    cycle rule. If they do not the result will not be correct. The cycle
    rule states that the second vertex of each edge of each triangle must be
    the first vertex in the next edge of that triangle. For example take the
    triangle drawn below:
              1
             /\
          B /  \ C
           /____\
          0   A  2
    If the triangle is [A, B, C] the edges must be:
        A: [2, 0]
        B: [0, 1]
        C: [1, 2]
    If the triangle is [C, B, A] the edges must be:
        C: [2, 1]
        B: [1, 0]
        A: [0, 2]

    This must be true for ALL of the triangles. Such an arrangement of edges
    and triangles is not possible in general but is possible for the
    octahedron.

    Implementation Details
    ------------------------
    Using the triangle drawn above, we segment the triangle into four smaller
    triangles.
                  1
                 /\
                /  \
              b/____\c
              /\    /\
             /  \  /  \
            /____\/____\
           0      a     2

    Make new vertices at the center of each edge::
         b = (0+1)/2
         c = (1+2)/2
         a = (2+0)/2

    Normalize a, b, c, and replace each old edge with two new edges:
        [0, b]
        [1, c]
        [2, a]
        [b, 1]
        [c, 2]
        [a, 0]
    Make a new edge connecting each pair of new vertices in the triangle:
        [b, a]
        [a, c]
        [c, b]

    Construct new triangles, notice that each edge was created in such a way
    so that our new triangles follow the cycle rule:
        t1 [0b,ba,a0]
        t2 [1c,cb,b1]
        t3 [2a,ac,c2]
        t4 [ba,ac,cb]
